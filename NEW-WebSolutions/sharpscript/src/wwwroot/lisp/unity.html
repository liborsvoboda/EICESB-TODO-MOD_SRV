As `#Script` is a clean embeddable scripting language with no compilation, few dependencies and a 
[cascading Reflection Utils](https://docs.servicestack.net/reflection-utils#fast-reflection-apis) for utilizing the
fastest implementation capable per target platform, it's able to add scripting to most C#/.NET platforms supporting 
**.NET Framework** or **.NET Standard 2.0** target frameworks (e.g. .NET Core/Mono).

One of C#'s popular target platforms that's appealing to extend via scripting is the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com)
which allows you by-pass the slow dev iteration cycles letting you to rapidly prototype a scene, or dynamically
create one without needing to rebuild or redeploy your Game when downloading and evaluating scripts on-the-fly.

To showcase Lisp scripting in Unity we've added an in-game REPL and used it to create and modify Unity Game Objects:

This demo is just running a copy of [Unity's Karting MyFirstGame Project Template](https://learn.unity.com/project/karting-template) with
scripting support added. We'll go through how to add scripting support below. For reference, a copy of this project has been published to:

 - [github.com/ServiceStack/script-unity](https://github.com/ServiceStack/script-unity)

### Add ServiceStack.Common .dll's to your project

Follow the
[Using .NET 4.x in Unity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/cross-platform/unity-scripting-upgrade?view=vs-2019) guide
to add .NET .dll's to a unity project which requires adding the binaries from the [ServiceStack.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.Common)
NuGet package and all its dependencies to your projects plugins folder and a 
[link.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/script-unity/master/MyFirstGame/Assets/link.xml) file to preserve
LINQ Expression Reflection support in Unity's [bytecode stripping](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP-BytecodeStripping.html):

 - [/Assets/link.xml](https://github.com/ServiceStack/script-unity/blob/master/MyFirstGame/Assets/link.xml)
 - [/Assets/Plugins](https://github.com/ServiceStack/script-unity/tree/master/MyFirstGame/Assets/Plugins)

To simplify downloading NuGet packages independently, a copy of **ServiceStack.Common** .dll's and all its dependencies is available from:

 - [/dist/ServiceStack.Common.zip](https://github.com/ServiceStack/script-unity/raw/master/dist/ServiceStack.Common.zip)

### Add REPL InputField and Text UI Objects  

Add the REPL UI `InputField` Control for capturing Lisp script **input** and a `Text` label for displaying REPL **output**: 

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/sharpscript/lisp-unity-inputfield.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/sharpscript/lisp-unity-inputfield.png)

Modify `InputField` by increasing the **height** and **width** of the control and changing the **Line Type** to **Multi Line Submit**:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/sharpscript/lisp-unity-inputfield-props.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/sharpscript/lisp-unity-inputfield-props.png)

> The positioning of each control can also be updated using Drag and Drop from Unity's Scene UI editor.

### Add New C# Script to your GameObject

We can then implement the behavior of our REPL by adding a **New Script** component to our GameObject:

The entire REPL behavior is encapsulated inside the
[ScriptExample.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/script-unity/blob/master/MyFirstGame/Assets/UTech/MG-Karting/BasicAssets/Scripts/SharpScript/ScriptExample.cs) below:

In `void Start()` you'll want to initialize any one-off initialization tasks like initializing the `ScriptContext` and
creating the `Lisp.Interpreter` that will be used to evaluate code within the Lisp REPL as well as storing references
to the current `gameObject`, `InputField` and `Text` UI controls.

`Update()` is where to put your scripts runtime logic which gets called once per frame. Here we listen out for the `Ctrl+Enter`
shortcut key combination to trigger evaluating the Lisp source code that's in the `InputField` text field. `lastScript`
is maintained to prevent multiple evaluations as `Update()` can be called multiple times with the same keyboard combination.

The same `Lisp.Interpreter` instance is used for each evaluation which maintains any state defined from previous evaluations.

### Unity Script Methods

Unfortunately Lisp can't access all of Unity's APIs directly where it doesn't appear you can access Unity's native API wrappers
from reflection, e.g:

### Ignoring Key Input when in REPL

The only other code changes needed was in the 
[KartRepositionTrigger.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/script-unity/blob/master/MyFirstGame/Assets/UTech/MG-Karting/BasicAssets/Scripts/Track/KartRepositionTrigger.cs)
and
[KeyboardInput.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/script-unity/blob/master/MyFirstGame/Assets/UTech/MG-Karting/BasicAssets/Scripts/KartSystems/Inputs/KeyboardInput.cs)
classes to ignore any Keyboard input whilst typing in the REPL:
