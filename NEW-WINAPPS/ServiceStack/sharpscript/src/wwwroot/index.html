</h1>

<p>
    <em>#Script</em> is a <a href="/docs/introduction#simplicity-end-to-end">simple</a>, fast, highly versatile and
    <a href="/docs/introduction#embed">embeddable scripting language</a>
    for .NET Core and .NET Apps that utilizes a 
    <a href="/docs/syntax">familiar JavaScript inspired expressive Syntax</a> 
    to enable dynamic scripting of .NET Apps via controlled access to pluggable 
    <a href="/docs/methods">methods</a> and <a href="/docs/arguments">arguments</a>
    within a <a href="/docs/sandbox">sandbox</a> environment - ensuring scripts are encapsulated and 
    encourages the use of reusable and testable components where live environments can be easily re-created and simulated. 
</p>

<p>
    <em>#Script</em> supports <a href="/docs/syntax">template</a> mode (default), 
    <a href="/scode/">code</a> mode and <a href="/lisp/">lisp</a>, see how they compare in C#'s 101 LINQ Examples:
</p>

<div class="text-center pt-3">
    <a href="/linq/restriction-operators" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg">template</a>
    <a href="/linq/restriction-operators?lang=code" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg">code</a>
    <a href="/linq/restriction-operators?lang=lisp" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg">lisp</a>
</div>

<h3>Popular Use Cases</h3>

<p>
    These qualities opens <em>#Script</em> up to a number of new use-cases that's better suited than Razor for maintaining 
    <a href="/usecases/content-websites">content-heavy websites</a>, <a href="/usecases/live-documents">live documents</a>,
    <a href="/usecases/email-templates">Email Templates</a> and can easily 
    <a href="/usecases/introspect-state">introspect the state of running .NET Apps</a> where they provide 
    <a href="/docs/servicestack-scripts#debug-template">valuable insight at a glance</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="embed">Embed in .NET</h3>

<p>
    After adding the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.Common">ServiceStack.Common</a> NuGet package,
    you can start executing <em>#Script</em> by initializing a <em>ScriptContext</em>
</p>

{{ 'gfm/introduction/01.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    The ScriptContext is the sandbox where all scripts are executed within, everything your script has access to and generates 
    is maintained within the ScriptContext. Once initialized you can start using it to evaluate scripts which you can do with:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/introduction/02.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    See <a href="/docs/introduction#embed">Embedding in .NET docs</a> for how to customize and add additional functionality to your <em>ScriptContext</em>.

</p>

<h3>Sharp Scripts</h3>

<p>
    The easiest way to get started is to use the <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool">dotnet web tool</a>
    to run a <a href="/docs/sharp-scripts">Sharp Script</a> in <a href="/docs/sharp-scripts#live-script-with-web-watch">watch mode</a>
    by creating a text file with the <em>.ss</em> extension and running it with <em>x watch &lt;name&gt;.ss</em>.
</p>

<h3>Exploratory programming</h3>

<p>
    Unlike most languages, <em>#Script</em> has 2 outputs, the side-effect of the script itself and its textual output which makes it ideal for 
    literate programming where executable snippets can be embedded inside an executable document. 
</p>
<p>
    <a href="/docs/syntax#code-blocks">code blocks</a> are a convenient markup for embedding executable scripts within a document without the 
    distracting boilerplate of wrapping each statement in expression blocks. Together with <em>x watch</em>, <em>#Script</em> allows for an iterative, 
    exploratory style of programming in a live programming environment that benefits many domains whose instant progressive feedback unleashes 
    an unprecedented amount of productivity, one of those areas it benefits is shell scripting where the iterative feedback is invaluable in 
    working towards a solution for automating the desired task.
</p>


<h4>Live Shell Scripting</h4>

<p>
    To provide a glimpse of the productivity of this real-time exploratory programming-style, here's an example
    of a task we needed to automate to import and rename <b>48px</b> SVG images from 
    <a href="https://github.com/google/material-design-icons">Material Design Icons Project</a>
    folders into the form needed in the <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/mix-tool">mix</a> Gists:
</p>

<blockquote>
YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/joXSHtfb_7g">youtu.be/joXSHtfb_7g</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
    Here we can see how we're able to progressively arrive at our solution without leaving the source code, with the <b>watched</b> script 
    automatically updated at each <em>Ctrl+S</em> save point where we're able to easily infer its behavior from its descriptive textual output.
</p>


<h4>Explore HTTP APIs in real-time</h4>

<p>
    The real-time scriptability of <em>#Script</em> makes it ideal for a whole host of Exploratory programming tasks that would otherwise be painful
    in the slow code/build/debug cycles of a compiled language like C#, like being able to cut, sort & slice HTTP APIs with ease:
</p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Live Querying of Databases</h4>

<p>
    It also serves a great tool for data exploration, akin to a programmable SQL Studio environment with instant feedback:
</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/HCjxVJ8RyPc"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/query-northwind.gif" alt=""></a>

<blockquote>
YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/HCjxVJ8RyPc">youtu.be/HCjxVJ8RyPc</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
    That benefits from being able to maintain reusable queries in simple, executable text files that can be organized along with other 
    shell scripts and treated like source code where it can be checked into a versionable repo, that anyone will be able to checkout and run 
    from the command-line in Windows, macOS or Linux OS's.
</p>

<h4>Querying AWS and Azure RDBMS and File Storage Resources</h4>

<p>
    Scripts have access to all built-in Scripts and ServiceStack's which makes it easy to create scripts 
    that run against 
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite#8-flavours-of-ormlite-is-on-nuget">all supported RDBMS's</a>
    and cloud agnostic <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Aws">ServiceStack.Aws</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Azure">ServiceStack.Azure</a> as seen below with the same script
    below performs adhoc queries against an AWS RDS PostgreSQL managed database and S3 File Storage and an Azure SQL Server 
    Database and Azure Blob File Storage:

</blockquote>

<h4>Live Transformations</h4>

<p>
    The <em>watch</em> mode enables an live REPL which serves as an interactive Exploratory playground 
    that's especially useful in scripts where you want instant feedback like viewing the results of 
    <a href="/docs/sharp-scripts#live-transformations">live transformations</a>:

<h3>Sharp Apps</h3>

<p>
    One use-case made possible by <em>#Script</em> we're extremely excited about is <a href="/docs/sharp-apps">Sharp Apps</a> - a new approach to 
    dramatically simplify .NET Web App development and provide the most productive development experience possible. 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="/docs/sharp-apps">Sharp Apps</a> leverages <em>#Script</em> to develop entire content-rich, data-driven websites in a pure live development model 
    without needing to write any C#, compile projects or manually refresh pages. Checkout the Spirals Sharp App below 
    for a glimpse of the Live Development experience available:

<p>
    The integrated development experience extends to end-to-end to provide a seamless installation and deployment experience where the 
    same <em>x</em> dotnet tool used to develop Sharp Apps is all users need to find and install Apps locally or hosted as a server App 
    where they're easily deployed and <a href="/docs/deploying-sharp-apps">hosted on Linux or run within Docker</a> -
    the overall Sharp Apps experience results in the easiest and fastest way to develop and deploy Web Apps in .NET!
</p>

<h3>GitHub Desktop Apps</h3>

<p>
    Sharp Apps can also be published to Gists where they can be <b>run on-the-fly without installation</b>, they're always up-to-date, have tiny 
    footprints are fast to download and launch that can also run locally, off-line and cross-platform across Windows, macOS and Linux OS's.

<h4>Pure Cloud Apps</h4>

<p>
    <a href="/docs/sharp-apps">Sharp Apps</a> also enable the development of <a href="/docs/sharp-apps#pure-cloud-apps">Pure Cloud Apps</a> 
    where the same SharpApp can be developed and run entirely on <em>AWS S3 and RDS</em> or <em>Azure Blob Storage and SQL Server</em> 
    by just changing its <em>app.settings</em>.
</p>

<h3>Learn #Script</h3>

<p>
    Get started learning <em>#Script</em> by going through the <a href="/docs/installation">Interactive Guide</a> and creating
    a <a href="/docs/installation#starter-projects">Starter Project</a>.
</p>

<p>
    View the source code of this 
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/sharpscript">#Script Pages website</a> to see how clean a website built with it is.
</p>

<p>
    Checkout the <a href="/linq/">Live LINQ examples</a> for a fun Live programming experience to explore its querying features, as a quick
    preview here's a copy of the <a href="/linq/restriction-operators">first LINQ example</a> you can play with below:
</p>

{{ "linq-preview" |> partial({ rows: 7, example: "linq01" }) }}

<p>
    Or can be written using different languages within the same <em>#Script</em> using
    <a href="/docs/syntax#lang-blocks">Language Blocks and Expressions</a>:
</p>

{{ "linq-preview" |> partial({ rows: 11, example: "linq01-langs", lang:"template" }) }}

<h5 id="language">Language</h5>

<p>
    The language itself a familiar combination of
    <a href="/docs/expression-viewer">JavaScript expressions</a> contained within Template Expressions popularized in    
    <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/filters.html">Vue.js filters</a> and 
    <a href="https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#template-expression-operators">Angular's Template Expressions</a>
    whilst statements adopt <a href="/docs/blocks">Handlebars block helpers</a> syntax. The language is also highly extensible which is pre-configured
    <a href="/docs/default-scripts">comprehensive suite of safe methods</a> and blocks by default, but are all registered via its 
    rich plugin functionality which can be completely removed or "shadowed" (aka overridden) where it could be used to form the basis of your
    own completely different DSL.
</p>

<h5 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h5>

<p>
    In addition to the language, <em>#Script</em> includes a surrounding ecosystem of rich functionality adapting <em>#Script</em>
    to power a number of fun and exciting scenarios. E.g. Scripts are lazily loaded from its Virtual File System
    which can be configured to use any of the <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system">available Virtual File Systems</a>
    and is what enables <a href="/docs/sharp-apps#pure-cloud-apps">Pure Cloud Apps</a> where <b>entire</b> Sharp Apps could be hosted within
    your AWS S3 Bucket or Azure Blob Storage.
</p>

<h5 id="dynamic">Dynamic</h5>

<p>
    It's small, lightweight footprint and built-in <a href="/docs/hot-reloading">Hot Reloading</a>
    provides a fun, clean and productive alternative to MVC Razor that's easily 
    <a href="/docs/sharp-pages">integrated into any web framework</a> and runs identically in 
    <a href="/docs/sharp-pages#runs-everywhere">every platform ServiceStack runs on</a>, as well as
    within <a href="/mvc-netcore#aspnet-mvc--templates-demo">ASP.NET MVC</a> and <a href="/docs/mvc-netcore">ASP.NET Core MVC</a> 
    Controllers - in all cases, using the same <a href="/docs/introduction#instant-startup">high-performance implementation</a>    
    to asynchronously write to a forward-only OutputStream for max performance and maximum potential reuse of your Source Code.
</p>

<p>
    <em>#Script</em> scripts are lazily loaded and <a href="/docs/introduction#late-bound">late-bound</a> for Instant Startup, doesn't require any 
    pre-compilation, coupling to any external configuration files, build tools, designer tooling or have any special deployment requirements.
    It can be used as a general purpose scripting or templating language to generate <a href="/docs/page-formats">any text format</a> 
    and includes built-in support for <em>.html</em>.
</p>

<h5 id="encapsulated">Encapsulated</h5>

<p>
    Similar to <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html">Vue.js Components</a>, Sharp Script's are evaluated in an 
    <a href="/docs/sandbox">Encapsulated Sandbox</a> that enables fine-grained control over exactly what functionality and instances 
    are available to different Scripts. They're pre-configured with a comprehensive suite of safe 
    <a href="/docs/default-scripts">Default Scripts</a> which when running in trusted contexts can easily be granted access to 
    <a href="/docs/scripts-reference">enhanced functionality</a>.
</p>

<h5 id="simple">Simple</h5>

<p>
    <em>#Script</em> is designed to be incrementally adoptable where its initial form is
    <a href="/docs/sharp-apps#ideal-for-web-designers-and-content-authors">ideal for non-programmers</a>, 
    that can gradually adopt more power and functionality when needed where they can leverage existing Services or MVC Controllers 
    to enable an 
    <a href="/docs/model-view-controller">MVC programming model</a> or have <em>.html</em> pages upgraded to use 
    <a href="/docs/code-pages">Code Pages</a> where they can utilize the full unlimited power of the C# programming language to 
    enable precise control over the rendering of pages and partials. Code pages take precedence and are interchangeable wherever 
    normal <em>.html</em> pages are requested making them a non-invasive alternative whenever advanced functionality is required.
</p>

<h3>Free!</h3>

<p>
    We believe we've only scratched the surface of what's possible with <em>#Script</em> and we'd love to see what new 
    use-cases it can help achieve and help encourage an ecosystem of pluggable and reusable scripts, <em>#Script</em> is 
    being developed in <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack.Common">ServiceStack.Common</a> which is a
