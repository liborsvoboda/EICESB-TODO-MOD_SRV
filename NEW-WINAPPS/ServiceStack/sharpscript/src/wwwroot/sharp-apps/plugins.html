<p>
    Up till now the Apps above only have only used functionality built into ServiceStack, to enable even greater functionality
    but still retain all the benefits of developing Web Apps you can drop <b>.dll</b> with custom functionality into your 
    Web App's <em>/plugins</em> folder. The plugins support in Web Apps is as friction-less as we could make it, there's no 
    configuration to maintain or special interfaces to implement, you're able to drop your <b>existing implementation .dll's</b> 
    as-is into the App's <b>/plugins</b> folder.
</p>

<p>
    Plugins allow "no touch" sharing of 
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/plugins">ServiceStack Plugins</a>, 
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/create-your-first-webservice">Services</a>,

    <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/code-pages">Sharp Code Pages</a>,

    contained within <b>.dll's</b> or <b>.exe's</b> dropped in a Sharp App's 
    <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/plugins/tree/master/plugins">/plugins</a> folder which are auto-registered 
    on startup. This source code for plugins used in this App were built from the .NET 5.0 projects in the
    <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/plugins/tree/master/src">/plugins/src</a> folder.

<h4>Registering ServiceStack Plugins</h4>

<p>
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/plugins">ServiceStack Plugins</a> can be added to your App by 
    listing it's Type Name in the <em>features</em> config entry in 
    <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/plugins/tree/master/app.settings">app.settings</a>:
</p>

<pre class="settings"><code>debug true
name Plugins Sharp App
features CustomPlugin, OpenApiFeature, PostmanFeature, CorsFeature, ValidationFeature
CustomPlugin { ShowProcessLinks: true }
ValidationFeature { ScanAppHostAssemblies: true }
CefConfig { width:1150, height:1050 }
</code></pre>

<p>
    All plugins listed in <em>features</em> will be added to your Web App's AppHost in the order they're specified. 
    They can further customized by adding a separate config entry with the Plugin Name and a JavaScript Object literal to 
    populate the Plugin at registration, e.g the config above is equivalent to:
</p>

<h4>Custom Plugin</h4>

<p>
    In this case it tells our <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/plugins/blob/master/src/ServerInfo/CustomPlugin.cs">CustomPlugin</a>
    from <b>/plugins/ServerInfo.dll</b> to also show Process Links in its
    <a href="http://plugins.web-app.io/metadata">/metadata</a> Page:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/sharp-apps/05.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    Where as it was first registered in the list will appear before any links registered by other plugins:
</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sharp-apps/plugins/master/assets/img/metadata-screenshot.png" alt="Metadata screenshot">

<h4>Built-in Plugins</h4>

<p>
    It also tells the <em>ValidationFeature</em> to scan all Service Assemblies for Validators and to automatically register them
    which is how ServiceStack was able to find the
    <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/plugins/blob/master/src/ServerInfo/ContactServices.cs">ContactValidator</a>
    used to validate the <em>StoreContact</em> request.
</p>

<p>
    Other optional plugins registered in this App is the metadata Services required for 
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/openapi">Open API</a>, 
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/postman">Postman</a> as well as
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/corsfeature">support for CORS</a>.
    You can check the <a href="https://sharpscript.net/docs/servicestack-scripts#debug-template">Metadata Debug Inspector</a> for all Plugins 
    loaded in your AppHost.
</p>

<h3 id="netcore-extensibility">.NET Extensibility</h3>

<p>
    Plugins can also implement .NET Core's <em>IStartup</em> to be able to register any required dependencies without any coupling to any Custom AppHost.
</p>

<p>
    To simplify configuration you can use the <em>plugins/*</em> wildcard in 
    <b>app.settings</b> at the end of an ordered plugin list to register all remaining Plugins it finds in the apps <em>/plugins</em> folder:
</p>


<pre class="settings"><code>features OpenApiFeature, PostmanFeature, CorsFeature, ValidationFeature, plugins/*
CustomPlugin { ShowProcessLinks: true }
</code></pre>

<p>
    Each plugin registered can continue to be furthered configured by specifying its name and a JavaScript object literal as seen above.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/dotnet-app/tree/master/src/apps/plugins2">/plugins2</a>  App shows an example of this with the 
    <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/plugins/blob/master/src/ServerInfo/StartupPlugin.cs">StartupPlugin</a>
    registering a <em>StartupDep</em> dependency which is used by its <em>StartupServices</em> at runtime:

<h3>ServiceStack Ecosystem</h3>

<p>
    All Services loaded by plugins continue to benefit from ServiceStack's rich metadata services, including being listed 
    in the <a href="/metadata">/metadata</a> page, being able to explore and interact with Services using 
    <a href="/swagger-ui/">/swagger-ui/</a> as well as being able to generate Typed APIs for the most popular
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference">Mobile, Web and Desktop platforms</a>.
