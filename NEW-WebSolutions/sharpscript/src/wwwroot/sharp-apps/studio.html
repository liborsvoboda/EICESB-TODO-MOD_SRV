**[ServiceStack Studio](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Studio)**  is a capability-based UI to manage multiple remote ServiceStack instances from 
either a Chromium Desktop App or cross-platform .NET Core Web App. 

The richer metadata in ServiceStack Services allows Studio to logically group Services around Data Models, enabling its high-level semantic features 
like its native data-grid like UX over all AutoQuery Services to quickly discover, search, create, update and delete entities based on the available 
AutoQuery APIs and whether Authenticated Users have access to them.
