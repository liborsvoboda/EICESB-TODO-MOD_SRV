    <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/chat/tree/master/app">/chat</a> is an example of the ultimate form 
    of extensibility where instead of just being able to add Services, Methods and Plugins, etc. You can add your entire 
    <em>AppHost</em> which Sharp Apps will use instead of its own. This vastly expands the use-cases that can be built with 
    Sharp Apps as it gives you complete fine-grained control over how your App is configured.

<h4>Develop back-end using .NET IDE's</h4>

<p>
    For <a href="http://chat.web-app.io">chat.web-app.io</a> we've taken a copy of the existing .NET 5.0 
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Chat">Chat App</a> and moved its C# code to
    <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/chat/tree/master/src">/chat/src</a>
    and its files to <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/chat">/chat</a> 
    where it can be developed like any other Web App except it utilizes the Chat AppHost and implementation in the 
    <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/chat/blob/master/src/Program.cs">SelfHost Chat App</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Customizations from the original 
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Chat/blob/master/src/Chat/Startup.cs">.NET Core Chat implementation</a> 
    includes removing MVC and Razor dependencies and configuration, extracting its 
    <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/chat/tree/master/_layout.html">_layout.html</a> and 
    converting <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/chat/tree/master/index.html">index.html</a>
    to use <em>#Script</em> from its original 
    <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/Chat/blob/master/src/Chat/wwwroot/default.cshtml">default.cshtml</a>.
    It's also been enhanced with the ability to evaluate scripts from the Chat window, as seen in the screenshot above.

<h4>Chat AppHost</h4>

<h5>Reusing Web App's app.setting and files</h5>

<p>
    One nice thing from being able to reuse existing AppHost's is being able to develop all back-end C# Services and Custom Filters 
    as a stand-alone .NET Core Project where it's more productive with access to .NET IDE tooling and debugging.
</p>

<p>
    To account for these 2 modes we use <em>AddIfNotExists</em> to only register the <em>SharpPagesFeature</em> plugin 
    when running as a stand-alone App and add an additional constructor so it reuses the existing <em>app.settings</em> as its 
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/appsettings">IAppSettings</a> provider for is custom App configuration like OAuth App keys 
    required for enabling Sign-In's via with Twitter, Facebook and GitHub when running on <em>https://localhost:5001</em>:        
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>debug true
name Chat Sharp App
port 5001

oauth.RedirectUrl https://localhost:5001/
oauth.CallbackUrl https://localhost:5001/auth/{0}
oauth.facebook.Permissions email
oauth.facebook.AppId 531608123577340
oauth.facebook.AppSecret 9e1e6591a7f15cbc1b305729f4b14c0b

CefConfig { width:1150, height:1050 }
</code></pre>

<p>
    After the back-end has been implemented we can build and copy the compiled <b>Chat.dll</b> into the Chat's 
    <a href="https://github.com/sharp-apps/chat/tree/master/plugins">/plugins</a> folder where 
    we can take advantage of the improved development experience for rapidly developing its UI.
