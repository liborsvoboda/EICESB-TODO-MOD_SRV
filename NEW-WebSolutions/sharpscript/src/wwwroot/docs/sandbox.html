<p>
    Another useful feature of <em>#Script</em> is that it operates within a controlled sandbox where each <em>ScriptContext</em> instance is 
    isolated and defines the entire execution environment on which scripts are executed within as such it should be safe to run
    scripts from untrusted 3rd Party sources as they're confined to what's available within their allowed <em>ScriptContext</em> instance. 
</p>

<h4>ScriptContext</h4>

<p>
    By default the only functionality and objects <em>#Script</em> has access to is what's pre-configured within a new     
    <em>ScriptContext</em> instance which has access to
    <a href="/docs/default-scripts">Default Scripts</a>, <a href="/docs/html-scripts">HTML Scripts</a> and 
    default <a href="/docs/blocks">Script Blocks</a>.
    <em>#Script</em> can't call methods on instances or have any other way to invoke a method unless it's explicitly registered. 
</p>

<p>
    To give additional functionality to your Scripts extend the <em>ScriptContext</em> that executes your script with additional:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/docs/arguments">Arguments</a>
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>

<h3>Protected Scripts</h3>

<p>
    When running in a trusted contexts like Server Scripts in <a href="/docs/sharp-pages">#Script Pages</a>, scripts have elevated
    privileges with access to <a href="/docs/protected-scripts">Protected Scripts</a>, 
    <a href="/docs/servicestack-scripts">ServiceStack and Info Scripts</a>, 
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/server-ui-controls">Bootstrap Scripts</a> and 
    <a href="/docs/blocks#servicestack-blocks">ServiceStack Blocks</a>.  
</p>

<p>
    <a href="/docs/protected-scripts">Protected Scripts</a> allows your Scripts to escape the default sandbox and create new instances
    on existing .NET Types, populate them and call their methods as <a href="/docs/script-net">documented in Scripting .NET</a>. 
    There are 2 levels of access available:
</p>

<h4>Script Assemblies and Types</h4>

<p>
    You can limit which Types are scriptable by specifying just the individual Types:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/sandbox/04.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4>AllowScriptingOfAllTypes</h4>

<p>
    To give your Scripts maximum accessibility, you can give them access to all .NET Types in loaded assemblies:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/sandbox/05.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    Use <em>ScriptNamespaces</em> to include additional Lookup namespaces for resolving Types similar to C# <em>using</em> statements.
</p>

<p>
    See <a href="/docs/script-net">Scripting .NET</a> for how to access .NET Types in <em>#Script</em>.
</p>

<h4>Running untrusted Scripts</h4>

<p>
    If running a script from an untrusted source we recommend running them within a new <em>ScriptContext</em> instance so they're 
    kept isolated from any other <em>ScriptContext</em> instance. Context's are cheap to create, so there won't be a noticeable delay when 
    executing in a new instance but they're used to cache compiled lambda expressions which will need to be recreated if executing script
    in new ScriptContext instances. For improved performance you can instead have all untrusted templates use the same
    ScriptContext instance that way they're able to reuse existing caches and compiled expressions.
</p>

<h4 id="remove-default-scripts">Remove Default Scripts</h4>

<p>
    If you want to start from a clean slate, the default scripts can be removed by clearing the <em>ScriptMethods</em> collection:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/sandbox/01.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="disable-filters">Disabling adhoc Filters</h4>

<p>
    Or if you only want to disable access to some filters without removing them all, you can disable access to adhoc filters
    by adding to the <em>ExcludeFiltersNamed</em> collection:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/sandbox/02.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<blockquote>
    Script Methods can also be disabled on an individual <em>PageResult</em> by populating its <em>ExcludeFiltersNamed</em> collection.
</blockquote>

<h4>Instance creation and MaxQuota</h4>

<p>
    The only instances that can be created within scripts are what's allowed in 
    <a href="/docs/syntax#javascript-literals">JavaScript Literals</a> and the
    <a href="/docs/default-scripts#generation">Generation and Repeating Filters</a>. To limit any potential CPU and GC abuse any default scripts
    that can generate instances are limited to a <em>MaxQuota</em> of <b>10000</b> iterations. This quota can be modified with:    
</p>

{{ 'gfm/sandbox/03.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4>Max Stack Depth</h4>

<p>
    To prevent <a href="/docs/blocks#function">user-defined functions</a> from causing out of memory Exceptions its execution is limited to
    a Maximum Stack Depth which can be configured with:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>ScriptConfig.MaxStackDepth = 25; //default</code></pre>
