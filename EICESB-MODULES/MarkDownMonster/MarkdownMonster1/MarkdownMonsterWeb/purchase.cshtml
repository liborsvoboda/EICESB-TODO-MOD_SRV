#### Upgrades from a previous Version {#upgrades}
If you purchased a license for Markdown Monster 2.x or 1.x, you can **upgrade your license** to version 3.x at a discount by using this link:

<p class="mt-5">
      <a href="https://store.west-wind.com/product/order/markdown_monster_up_3" class="btn btn-primary license-button" style="display: block;">
         <i class="fa fa-check-circle" style="color: lightgreen"></i>&nbsp;
         Upgrade to v3
     </a>     
 </p>

To qualify, you need to have a previous version license that we can verify. If you ordered under the same name and company there's nothing else to do and we'll match your old order to the new order. If we can't match a previous order, we may ask for an order number or your matching name/company from the previous version order.


#### Multi-user Runtime Upgrades {#runtimeupgrades}
You can upgrade any of your previous version multi-user Markdown Monster runtime licenses to the latest version at a **50% discount** off the full price of the same multi-user license. You can use the following Promo code in the store to apply to runtime license upgrades: **RUNTIME_UGPRADE**.

> **Note:** All upgrades are manually verified and confirmed, so they are not immediately fulfilled. Please allow up to 24 hours for confirmation.

#### Minor version updates are always free <small>(ie. `v3.0` to `v3.99`)  </small>
Simply update to the latest version, and your v3 license is automatically applied for the the latest v3 update.

<!--
#### Upgrade for free to v3 if you purchased v2 after June 30th, 2022
Our policy is to provide free upgrades if your license was purchased within a year of a new release. 
So if you purchased v2 **after June 30th, 2022** you qualify for a free upgrade to 3.0. 

To apply for a free upgrade:

* Make sure your previous v2 order was after June 30th, 2022
* Go to to our store and <a href="https://store.west-wind.com/product/markdown_monster_free_up_3">place an order for an upgrade</a> using your existing account
* There will be no charge
* We'll verify your request
* If valid, we'll confirm your upgrade order
* If there's an issue we'll contact you via your account email address

## Markdown Monster License
Markdown Monster comes in several license modes:

* Evaluation
* Single User
* Multiple User
* Site/Organization License

Markdown Monster is a licensed product that requires a paid-for license for continued use. The software is licensed *© Rick Strahl, West Wind Technologies, 2015-@DateTime.Now.Year*.

A fully functional, free evaluation version is available for evaluation use, but continued use requires purchase of a license.

</a>

#### Evaluation License

The Evaluation version has all the features and functionality of the registered version, except that it shows occasional evaluation notices. Tampering with or removing of the notices is not allowed with the evaluation license.

You can use the evaluation version with the notices enabled, but if you continue to use Markdown Monster regularly or for commercial use, please register your copy and support further development and maintenance that benefit all via regular feature updates.

#### Purchased License

For continued use or commercial use of Markdown Monster, a paid-for license is required. The paid-for license removes the evaluation notices.

Each licensed user must have a separate license, but an individual user may use multiple copies of Markdown Monster on multiple machines.

The multi-user licenses work the same as a single user license applied to the number of users specified on the license purchased. An organizational site license is available to allow any number of users running unlimited numbers of Markdown Monster instances within a single commercial, non-profit or government organization.

Any purchased license is valid for the duration of the major release that it was purchased for (ie. 1.00-1.99) and minor version updates within that major version are always free. Upgrade pricing is available for major version upgrades, usually at somewhere near half of full price. It is our policy to allow for free upgrades to the next major version within a year of purchase of an older version.


#### Source Code{#SourceCode}
Due to rampant abuse of the original publicly accessible repository, public source code access is no longer available. Markdown Monster source code is now available on a **per request basis in a private GitHub repository** and you can request access to the private repository.  

Licensing outlined above applies to the source code. We allow for modification of source code only for internal use of Markdown Monster in your organization or for submitting pull requests to the Markdown Monster main repository. 

***Under no circumstances are you allowed to re-package or re-distribute any part of Markdown Monster outside of your organization.***

To request access for the private repository please:

* Provide a GitHub email address
* A brief note what you plan to use access for
* Send the request to `markdownmonster@@west-wind.com`

Access to the repository is by our discretion.
