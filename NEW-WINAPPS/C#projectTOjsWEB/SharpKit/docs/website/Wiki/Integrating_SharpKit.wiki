= Integrating SharpKit =
This chapter will explain how to start using SharpKit in new or existing projects, SharpKit easily integrates into any project type, whether it's a web application, class library or even console application.

== Creating a new project with SharpKit ==
  * Open Visual Studio
  * Click File -> New Project
  * Select Visual C# -> SharpKit -> SharpKit Web Application and click Ok.
SharpKit enabled ASP.NET web application will be created with an aspx page, and a C# code-behind with a class that is converted to JavaScript during compilation. 

== Integrating SharpKit into an existing project ==
Add the following line on your .csproj file: (add it right after all 'Import' sections in your project file)
WebApp.csproj
{{{
<!--This line is in any .csproj file: -->
<Import Project="$(MSBuildBinPath)\Microsoft.CSharp.targets" />
<!--Add this line after all Import sections: -->
<Import Project="$(MSBuildBinPath)\SharpKit\5\SharpKit.Build.targets" />
}}}
Add the following references into your project:
  * SharpKit.JavaScript.dll (you must add this reference)
  * SharpKit.Html.dll
SharpKit supports any C# type project, including web, console (.exe) and class library (.dll) project types.

== Upgrading from SharpKit v2 to SharpKit v5 ==
Edit your .csproj file, replace the SharpKit v2 import line, with the SharpKit v4 import line:
WebApp.csproj
{{{
<!--Replace this line:-->
<Import Project="$(MSBuildBinPath)\SharpKit\SharpKit.Build.targets" />
<!--With this line:-->
<Import Project="$(MSBuildBinPath)\SharpKit\5\SharpKit.Build.targets" />
}}}
Update assembly references, make sure to update SharpKit.JavaScript.dll, never reference both assemblies. SharpKit v4 assemblies are located in your Program Files\SharpKit\4\ folder.

== Upgrading from SharpKit v4 to SharpKit v5 ==
Edit your .csproj file, replace the SharpKit v4 import line, with the SharpKit v5 import line:
WebApp.csproj
{{{
<!--Replace this line:-->
<Import Project="$(MSBuildBinPath)\SharpKit\4\SharpKit.Build.targets" />
<!--With this line:-->
<Import Project="$(MSBuildBinPath)\SharpKit\5\SharpKit.Build.targets" />
}}}
