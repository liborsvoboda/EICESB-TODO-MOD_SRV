```csharp
var context = new ScriptContext {
    ScriptLanguages = { ScriptLisp.Language },
    ScriptMethods = { new ProtectedScripts() },
};
context.VirtualFiles.WriteFile("lib1.l", "(defn lib-calc [a b] (+ a b))");
context.VirtualFiles.WriteFile("/dir/lib2.l", "(defn lib-calc [a b] (* a b))");
context.Init();
```

You can load these scripts by symbol name where it assumes a `.l` extension, by quoting the argument so 
Lisp doesn't try to evaluate it as an argument, e.g:

```lisp
(load 'lib1)

(lib-calc 4 5) ;= 9
```

Alternatively you can specify the virtual path to the script. You can load multiple scripts with the same definitions,
in Lisp this just updates the value assigned to the symbol name with the latest definition, e.g:

```lisp
(load "lib1.l")

(lib-calc 4 5) ;= 9

(load "/dir/lib2.l")

(lib-calc 4 5) ;= 20
```

### Import Scripts from URLs

Inspired by [Deno](https://deno.land) you can also import remote scripts from URLs, e.g:

```lisp
(load "https://example.org/lib.l")
```

### Locally Cached

Like [Deno](https://deno.land/manual.html) all remote resources are cached after first use so after it's loaded once it only loads the locally cached
version of the script (where it will still work in an airplane without an internet connection). This cache is maintained 
under a `.lisp` folder at your configured Virtual Files provider (that can be deleted to clear any caches). 

For Sharp Scripts or Apps using the `x` or `app` dotnet tools it's stored in its own cache folder that can be cleared with: 

    $ x --clean

### Import Scripts from Gists

There's also first-class support for gists which you can reference with `gist:<gist-id>`, e.g:

```lisp
(load "gist:2f14d629ba1852ee55865607f1fa2c3e")
```

This will load all gist files in gist order, if you only to load a single file from a gist you can specify it with: 

```lisp
(load "gist:2f14d629ba1852ee55865607f1fa2c3e/lib1.l")
```

### Script Lisp Library Index

To provide human readable names to remote Lisp Scripts and a discoverable catalog where anyone can share their own scripts,
you reference gists by name listed in the [#Script Lisp Library Index](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/3624b0373904cfb2fc7bb3c2cb9dc1a3)
which is itself a self-documenting machine and human readable gist of named links to external gists maintained by their 
respective authors.

Index library references can be loaded using the format `index:<name>`, e.g:

```lisp
(load "index:lib-calc")
```

Which also support being able to reference individual gist files:

```lisp
(load "index:lib-calc/lib1.l")
```

If you'd like to share your own Lisp Scripts with everyone and publish your library to the index, just add a link
to your gist with your preferred name in the [Gist Index Comments](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/3624b0373904cfb2fc7bb3c2cb9dc1a3).

### Viewing Script Source Code

You can view the source code of any load script references with `load-src`, e.g: 

```lisp
(load-src 'lib)
(load-src "/dir/lib2.l")
(load-src "https://example.org/lib.l")
(load-src "gist:2f14d629ba1852ee55865607f1fa2c3e/lib1.l")
(load-src "index:lib-calc")
```

### Disable Remote Imports

Should you wish, you can prevent anyone from loading remote scripts with:

```csharp
Lisp.AllowLoadingRemoteScripts = false;
```
