order: 6

<p>
    <em>#Script</em> scripts are sandboxed, they can't call methods on objects nor do they have any access to any static functions built into the .NET Framework,
    so just as Arguments define all data and objects available, script methods define all functionality available to scripts.     
</p>

<p>
    The only methods registered by default are the <a href="/docs/default-scripts">Default Scripts</a>
    containing a comprehensive suite of scripts useful within <a href="/docs/sharp-pages">#Script Pages</a> or custom Scripting environments and 
    <a href="/docs/html-scripts">HTML Scripts</a>. 
    There's nothing special about these script methods other than they're pre-registered by default, your scripts have access to the same 
    APIs and functionality and can do anything that built-in scripts can do. 
</p>

<h4>What are Script Methods?</h4>

<p>
    Script methods are just C# public instance methods from a class that inherits from <em>ScriptMethods</em>, e.g:
</p>

<h4 id="registering-methods">Registering Methods</h4>

<p>
    The examples below show the number of different ways scripts can be registered:
</p>

<h5>Add them to the ScriptContext.ScriptMethods</h5>

<p>
    Methods can be registered by adding them to the <em>context.ScriptMethods</em> collection directly:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/methods/04.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>That can now be called with:</p>

{{ 'gfm/methods/05.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    This also shows that Scripts are initialized and have access to the <em>ScriptContext</em> through the <em>Context</em> property.
</p>

<h5>Add them to PageResult.ScriptMethods</h5>

<p>
    If you only want to use a custom script in a single Page, it can be registered on the <em>PageResult</em> that renders it instead:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/methods/06.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h5>Autowired using ScriptContext IOC</h5>

<p>
    Autowired instances of scripts can also be created using ScriptContext's configured IOC where they're 
    also injected with any registered IOC dependencies. To utilize this you need to specify the Type of the ScriptMethods that 
    should be Autowired by either adding it to the <em>ScanTypes</em> collection:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/methods/07.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    When the <em>ScriptContext</em> is initialized it will go through each Type and create an autowired instance of each Type
    and register them in the <em>ScriptMethods</em> collection. An alternative to registering a single Type is to register 
    an entire Assembly, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/methods/08.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    Where it will search each Type in the Assembly for Script Methods and automatically register them.
</p>

<h3>Method Resolution</h3>

<p>
    #Script will use the first matching method with the same name and argument count it can find by searching through all 
    registered methods in the <em>ScriptMethods</em> collection, so you could override default methods with the same name by 
    inserting your ScriptMethods as the first item in the collection, e.g:
</p>

<h5 id="shadowing">Shadowing Methods</h5>

{{ 'gfm/methods/09.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h3>Delegate Arguments</h3>

<p>
    In addition to Script Methods, <em>#Script</em> also lets you call delegates registered as arguments:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/script-net/01.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    Which just like <a href="/docs/blocks#function">user-defined functions</a> and other Script Methods can be called positionally or as an
    <a href="/docs/syntax#extension-methods">extension method</a>:
</p>

<pre><code>fn(1,2)
1.fn(2)</code></pre>

<h4 id="removing">Removing Default Scripts</h4>

<p>
    Or if you want to start from a clean slate, the default scripts can be removed by clearing the collection:
</p>

<h4>Auto coercion into Method argument Types</h4>

<p>
    A unique feature of script methods is that each of their arguments are automatically coerced into the script method argument Type using the 
    powerful conversion facilities built into ServiceStack's 
    <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/auto-mapping">Auto Mapping Utils</a> and 
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Text">Text Serializers</a> which can deserialize most of .NET's primitive Types like 
    <em>DateTime</em>, <em>TimeSpan</em>, <em>Enums</em>, etc in/out of strings as well being able to convert a Collection into other Collection 
    Types and any Numeric Type into any other Numeric Type which is how, despite only accepting doubles: 
</p>

{{ 'gfm/methods/10.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    <em>squared</em> can also be used with any other .NET Numeric Type, e.g: <em>byte</em>, <em>int</em>, <em>long</em>, <em>decimal</em>, etc.
    The consequence to this is that there's no method overloading in script methods which are matched based on their name and their number of arguments
    and each argument is automatically converted into its script method Param Type before it's called.
</p>

<h4>Context Script Methods</h4>

<p>
    Script Methods can also get access to the current scope by defining a <em>ScriptScopeContext</em> as it's first parameter which 
    can be used to access arguments in the current scope or add new ones as done by the <em>assignTo</em> method:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/methods/11.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="block-methods">Block Methods</h4>

<p>
    Script Methods can also write directly into the OutputStream instead of being forced to return buffered output. A Block Method
    is declared by its <em>Task</em> return Type where instead of returning a value it instead writes directly to the 
    <em>ScriptScopeContext</em> OutputStream as seem with the implementation of the <em>includeFile</em> protected scripts:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/methods/12.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<blockquote>
    For maximum performance all default script methods which perform any I/O use Block Methods to write directly to the OutputStream 
    and avoid any blocking I/O or buffering. 
</blockquote>

<h4>Block Methods ends the template expression</h4>

<p>
    Block methods effectively end the filter chain expression since they don't return any value that can be injected into 
    a normal method. The only thing that can come after a Block Method are other Block Methods or Filter Transformers. 
    If any are defined, the output of the Block Method is buffered into a <em>MemoryStream</em> and passed into
    the next Block Method or Filter Transformer in the chain, its output is then passed into the next one in the chain if any, 
    otherwise the last output is written to the OutputStream.
</p>

<p>
    An example of using a Block method with a Filter Transformer is when you want include a markdown document and then 
    convert it to HTML using the <b>markdown</b> Filter Transformer before writing its HTML output to the OutputStream:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ pass: 'doc.md' |> includeFile |> markdown }}</code></pre>

<h4>Capture Block Method Output</h4>

<p>
    You can also capture the output of a Block Method and assign it to a normal argument by using the <em>assignTo</em> Block Method:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ pass: 'doc.md' |> includeFile |> to => contents }}</code></pre>

<h4 id="async">Async support</h4>

{{ 'gfm/methods/13.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4>Implementing Method Exceptions</h4>

<p>
    In order for your own Method Exceptions to participate in the above Script Error Handling they'll need to be wrapped in an
    <em>StopFilterExecutionException</em> including both the Script's <em>scope</em> and an optional <b>options</b> object 
    which is used to check if the <em>assignError</em> binding was provided so it can automatically populate it with the Exception.
</p>

<p>
    The easiest way to Implement Exception handling in methods is to call a managed function which catches all Exceptions and 
    throws them in a <em>StopFilterExecutionException</em> as seen in OrmLite's 
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.OrmLite/DbScripts.cs">DbScripts</a>:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/error-handling/03.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    The overloads are so the methods can be called without specifying any method options.
</p>
