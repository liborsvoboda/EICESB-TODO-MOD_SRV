```csharp
public class WithScriptBlock : ScriptBlock
{
    public override string Name => "with";

    public override async Task WriteAsync(
        ScriptScopeContext scope, PageBlockFragment block, CancellationToken token)
    {
        var result = await block.Argument.GetJsExpressionAndEvaluateAsync(scope,
            ifNone: () => throw new NotSupportedException("'with' block does not have a valid expression"));

        if (result != null)
        {
            var resultAsMap = result.ToObjectDictionary();

            var withScope = scope.ScopeWithParams(resultAsMap);
            
            await WriteBodyAsync(withScope, block, token);
        }
        else
        {
            await WriteElseAsync(scope, block.ElseBlocks, token);
        }
    }
}
```

This enables the `with` block to also evaluate async responses like the async results returned in [async Database scripts](/docs/db-scripts), 
it's also able to evaluate custom else statements for rendering different results based on alternate conditions, e.g:

```hbs
{{#with dbSingle("select * from Person where id = @id", { id }) }}
    Hi {{Name}}, your Age is {{Age}}.
{{else if id == 0}}
    id is required.
{{else}}
    No person with id {{id}} exists.
{{/with}}
```
