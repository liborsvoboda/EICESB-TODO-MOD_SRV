Code statements is an alternative language dialect which allows us to invert `#Script` from **"Template Mode"**
where all text is emitted as-is with only Template Expressions `{{ ... }}` being evaluated and changed it to **"Code Mode"** where all code
statements are evaluated as JS Expression statements.

This is akin to Razor's statement blocks which inverts Razor's **mode** of emitting text to treating text inside statement blocks as code, e.g:

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/syntax/05.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToCodeBlocks }}

{{#markdown}}

Which is useful in reducing boilerplate when you need to evaluate code blocks with 2+ or more lines without the distracting boilerplate of wrapping
each expression within a `{{ ... }}` Template Expression.

### Syntax

Effectively you can think of **Code** Statements as `#Script` without template expressions since the code within a Template Expressions `{{ ... }}` 
are both evaluated as JS Expressions. 

One difference between them is that each line in a code statement block must be a complete expression, any expressions that spans multiple 
lines need to be wrapped withing Template Expressions where-by the source code for both **Template** and **Code** blocks remain exactly the same, e.g:

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/scode/01.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}

The difference between them is that whitespace and indentation in code statement blocks are inert whereas they're emitted in Templates
so these examples are equivalent:

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/scode/02.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToCodeBlocks }}

<p>
    Whilst <em>code</em> statements can effectively be thought of as "#Script without Template Expressions", you can view the LINQ examples in each
    to see how they compare:
</p>

<div class="text-center py-3">
    <a href="/linq/restriction-operators?lang=code" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg">Code LINQ Examples</a>
    <span class="px-2"> vs </span>
    <a href="/linq/restriction-operators" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg">#Script LINQ Examples</a>
</div>

## Executing #Script Code in .NET

All `#Script` languages are executed within a `ScriptContext` that defines all functionality available to them, i.e:

{{/markdown}}

{{ "net-usage" |> partial }}

{{#markdown}}

But to render `code` statements you'd use `RenderCode` instead of `RenderScript`, e.g:

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/scode/03.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}

### Evaluating Script Results

If you instead wanted to access Script return values instead of the code rendered output you would use the `EvaluateCode()` APIs:

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/scode/04.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

## Scripting .NET Types

All `#Script` languages have the same access to [Scripting .NET Types](/docs/script-net).

## Code Scripts

The same functionality in [Sharp Scripts](/docs/sharp-scripts) is also available in `#Script` Code, except instead of using the `*.ss` file 
extension for executing `#Script` you'd use the `*.sc` file extension which will allow you to use the 
[x](https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool) and [app](/netcore-windows-desktop) dotnet tools to watch or run `code` scripts:

    $ x run code.sc
    $ x watch code.sc

### Watch `code` scripts

Here's a quick demo showcasing the same functionality in [Sharp Scripts](https://sharpscript.net/docs/sharp-scripts)
is also available in `*.sc` scripts which provides instant feedback whilst you develop in real-time:
