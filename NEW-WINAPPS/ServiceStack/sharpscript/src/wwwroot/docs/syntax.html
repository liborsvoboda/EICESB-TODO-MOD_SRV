<p>
    <em>#Script</em> aims to be a familiar and expressive dynamic language for scripting .NET Apps, that is optimal 
    at generating text, especially HTML where it's pre-configured with the
    <a href="/docs/page-formats">HTML Page Format</a> and <a href="/docs/html-scripts">HTML Scripts</a> but
    unlike C#'s Razor can support multiple pluggable page formats which can be used for generating any kind of text.
</p>

<p>
    For maximum familiarity #Script uses <a href="/docs/expression-viewer">JavaScript Expressions</a> 
    that for increased readability and expressiveness supports being used within Template Expressions
    which like <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html#Filters">Vue.js filters</a>,
    and <a href="https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#template-expression-operators">Angular's Template Expressions</a>
    lets you use the <em>|</em> pipe operator to chain the return values of methods into subsequent methods from left-to-right.
    For statements #Script adopts the familiar Handlebars-like
    <a href="/docs/blocks">Script Blocks</a> that is also popular among HTML templating engines.
</p>

<p>
    Effectively #Script lets you use the same familiar JS language for server HTML rendering as you would do
    in client-side rendering of Single Page Apps despite it binding natively to C# objects and calling C# methods behind-the-scenes.
</p>

<h4>Mustache expressions</h4>

<p>
    Like Vue/Angular Templates, only expressions inside mustaches are evaluated, whilst everything outside are emitted as-is:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ template: "outside <i>{{ 'shout' |> upper }}</i> text" }) }}

<p>
    Which calls the <em>upper</em> default script method where the argument on the left-side of the "pipe" symbol is 
    passed as the first argument to the upper method which is implemented as:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/syntax/01.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    This can be rewritten without the "pipe forward" operator by calling it as a method or an extension method instead:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ template: "outside <i>{{ upper('shout') }}</i> or <u>{{ 'shout'.upper() }}</u> text" }) }}

<h4>Methods can be chained</h4>

<p>
    Methods are chained from left-to-right where the value on the left side of the "pipe" symbol is passed as the first 
    argument in the method on the right and the output of that is passed as the input of the next method in the chain and so on:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ template: "{{ 'shout' |> upper |> substring(2) |> padRight(6, '_') |> repeat(3) }}" }) }}

<p>
    Methods can also accept additional arguments which are passed starting from the 2nd argument since the first 
    argument is the value the method is called with. E.g. here are the implementations for the <em>substring</em> and 
    <em>padRight</em> default scripts:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/syntax/02.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="javascript-literals">JavaScript literal notation</h4>

<p>
    You can use the same literal syntax used to define numbers, strings, booleans, null, Objects and Arrays in JavaScript
    within templates and it will get converted into the most appropriate .NET Type, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ rows: 8, template: "{{ null               |> typeName }}
{{ true               |> typeName }}
{{ 1                  |> typeName }}
{{ 1.1                |> typeName }}
{{ 'string'           |> typeName }}
{{ ['array', 'items'] |> typeName }}
{{ { key: 'value' }   |> typeName }}
" }) }}

<p>
    ES6 Shorthand notation is also supported where you can use the argument name as its property name in a Dictionary:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ template: "{{ var bar = 'foo'   }}
{{ var obj = { bar } }}
{{ obj['bar']        }}" }) }}

<h4>Local Variables</h4>

<p>
    Like JavaScript you can declare a locally scoped variable with <em>var</em>:
</p>

<pre><code>var sliders = dirFiles('img/sliders')</code></pre>

<p>
    Like JS you can use either <em>var</em>, <em>let</em> or <em>const</em> but they all behave like let and assign a locally scoped variable 
    at the time the expression is executed. Also like JS the semicolon is optional and you can assign multiple variables in a single expression:
</p>

<pre><code>let a = 1 + 2, b = 3 * 4, c, d = 'D';</code></pre>

<h4>Global Variables</h4>

<p>
    Global Variables in <em>#Script</em> are maintained in the <em>PageResult.Args</em> dictionary which you could previously assign to using the 
    <em>toGlobal</em> script method where it’s accessible to all scripts rendered within that <em>PageResult</em>.
</p>

<p>
    <em>#Script</em> now mimics JS's behavior to allow assignment expressions to assign global variables where **Assignment Expressions** on 
    undeclared variables (i.e. where no locally scoped variable exists) will assign a global variable:
</p>

<pre><code>a = 1</code></pre>

<p>
    A more descriptive syntax available to declare a global variable is to assign it to the <em>global</em> object (inspired by node’s global) 
    which is an alias to the <em>PageResult.Args</em> dictionary:
</p>

<pre><code>global.a = 1</code></pre>

<h4>Assignment Expressions</h4>

<p>
    In addition to declaring and assigning variables, there’s also support for using assignment expressions to assign and mutate Collections and 
    Type Properties using either Member Expression or Index expression syntax, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/syntax/11.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>
    Strings can be defined using single quotes, double quotes, prime quotes or backticks:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ rows:4, template: "{{ \"double quotes\" }}
{{ 'single quotes' }}
{{ ′prime quotes′ }}
{{ `backticks` }}" }) }}

<blockquote>
    Strings can also span multiple lines.
</blockquote>

<h4>Template Literals</h4>

Backticks strings implement <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">JavaScript's Template literals</a>
which can be be used to embed expressions:

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ rows:4, template: "{{ `Time is ${now}, expr= ${true ? pow(1+2,3) : ''}` }}
Prime Quotes     {{ now.TimeOfDay |> timeFormat(′h\\:mm\\:ss′) }}
Template Literal {{ now.TimeOfDay |> timeFormat(`h\\\\:mm\\\\:ss`) }}" }) }}

The example above also shows the difference in escaping where Template literals evaluate escaped characters whilst normal strings 
leave <em>\</em> backspaces unescaped.

<h4>Shorthand arrow expression syntax</h4>

<p>
    #Script Expressions have full support for JavaScript expressions but doesn't support statements or function declarations although it 
    does support JavaScript's arrow function expressions which can be used in functional methods to enable LINQ-like queries.
    You can use fat arrows <em>=></em> immediately after methods to define lambda's with an implicit <em>(it => ...)</em> binding, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ template: ′{{ [0,1,2,3,4,5]
   |> where => it >= 3
   |> map => it + 10 |> join(`\n`) }}′ }) }}

<p>
    This is a shorthand for declaring lambda expressions with normal arrow expression syntax:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ template: ′{{ [0,1,2,3,4,5]
    |> where(it => it >= 3)
    |> map(x => x + 10) |> join(`\n`) }}′ }) }}
 
<p>
    Using normal lambda expression syntax lets you rename lambda parameters as seen in the <em>map(x => ...)</em> example.
</p>

<h4>Special string argument syntax</h4>

<p>
    As string expressions are a prevalent in <em>#Script</em>, we've also given them special wrist-friendly syntax where you
    can add a colon at the end of the method name which says to treat the following characters up until the end of the
    line or mustache expression as a string, trim it and convert '{' and '}' chars into mustaches. With this syntax
    you can write:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ template: "{{ [3,4,5] |> select: { it |> incrBy(10) }\\n }}" }) }}

<p>
    and it will be rewritten into its equivalent and more verbose form of:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ template: "{{ [3,4,5] |> select(′{{ it |> incrBy(10) }}\\n′) }}" 
}) }}

<h4>SQL-like Boolean Expressions</h4>

<p>
    To maximize readability and intuitiveness for non-programmers, boolean expressions can also adopt an SQL-like syntax where
    instead of using <em>&amp;&amp;</em> or <em>||</em> operator syntax to define boolean expressions you can also
    use the more human-friendly <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> alternatives:
</p>

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ template: "{{ [0,1,2,3,4,5] 
   |> where => it.isOdd() and it == 3
   |> join }}" }) }}

<h4>Include Raw Content Verbatim</h4>

Use <em>#raw</em> blocks to ignore evaluating expressions and emit content verbatim. This is useful when using a
client Handlebars-like templating solution like Vue or Angular templates where expressions need to be evaluated 
with JavaScript in the browser instead of on the Server with Templates:

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ rows: 4, template: "{{#raw}}Hi {{ person.name }}, Welcome to {{ site.name }}!{{/raw}}

{{#raw template}}Assign contents with {{ expressions }} into 'template' argument{{/raw}}
Captured Argument: {{template}}" 
 }) }}

<h4>Multi-line Comments</h4>

<p>
    Any text within <em>{{#raw}}{{#noop}} ... {{/noop}}{{/raw}}</em> block statements are ignored and can be used for temporarily removing
    sections from pages without needing to delete it.
</p>

<p>
    Everything within multi-line comments <em>{{#raw}}{{&zwnj;*</em> and <em>*&zwnj;}}{{/raw}}</em> is ignored and removed from the page.
</p>

<p>
    An alternative way to temporarily disable an expression is to prefix the expression with the <em>end</em> method to 
    immediately short-circuit evaluation, e.g: <em>{{#raw}}{{ end |> now |> dateFormat }}{{/raw}}</em>
</p>

<p>
    See <a href="/docs/sharp-pages#ignoring-pages">Ignoring Pages</a> for different options for ignoring entire pages and 
    layout templates.

### Script Methods can be used as Extension Methods

A core feature of `#Script` is that it runs in a [sandbox](/sandbox) and only has access to functionality that's configured in its `ScriptContext`
that it runs in, so by design `#Script` is prohibited from calling instance methods so they only have a read-only view of your objects
unless you explicitly register `ScriptMethods` that allows them to change them. 

This frees up the `instance.method()` syntax to be put to other use which can now be used to call every script method as an extension method.
This can greatly improve the readability and execution flow of code, e,g. we can rewrite our previous 
[JS Utils Eval](https://docs.servicestack.net/js-utils#eval) example:

    itemsOf(3, padRight(reverse(arg), 8, '_'))

into the more readable form using the same methods as extension methods off the first argument, e.g:

    3.itemsOf(arg.reverse().padRight(8, '_'))

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/syntax/04.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}

### JavaScript Array Support

We can use extension methods to define instance methods that can be called on any object to implement JS Array methods support 
to further improve `#Script` source compatibility with JavaScript. 

Here are [Mozilla's Array examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) in `#Script`
utilizing its [Code Blocks](#code-blocks) feature to reduce the amount of boilerplate required:

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/syntax/03.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToCodeBlocks }}

{{#markdown}}

Which can be run with `x run {script}.ss` to view its expected output:

    Create an Array
    2

    Access (index into) an Array Item
    Apple

    Loop over an Array
    Apple, 0
    Banana, 1

    Apple, 0
    Banana, 1

    Add to the end of an Array
    3

    Remove from the end of an Array
    Orange

    Remove from the front of an Array
    Apple

    Add to the front of an Array
    2

    Find the index of an item in the Array
    1

    Remove an item by index position
    Banana
    Strawberry,Mango

    Remove items from an index position
    Cabbage,Turnip,Radish,Carrot
    Cabbage,Carrot
    Turnip,Radish

    Copy an Array
    Strawberry,Mango

Most JS Array methods are supported, including the latest additions from ES2019:

 - `concat`
 - `every`
 - `filter`
 - `find`
 - `findIndex`
 - `flat`
 - `flatMap`
 - `forEach`
 - `includes`
 - `indexOf`
 - `join`
 - `keys`
 - `lastIndexOf`
 - `map`
 - `pop`
 - `push`
 - `reduce`
 - `reverse`
 - `shift`
 - `slice`
 - `some`
 - `sort`
 - `splice`
 - `toString`
 - `unshift`
 - `values`

## Language Blocks and Expressions

We've caught a glimpse using language blocks with the `code` JavaScript Array Example above which allows us to invert `#Script` from **"Template Mode"**
where all text is emitted as-is with only code within Template Expressions `{{ ... }}` are evaluated and changed it to **"Code Mode"** where all code
is evaluated a code expression.

This is akin to Razor's statement blocks which inverts Razor's **mode** of emitting text to treating text inside statement blocks as code, e.g:

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/syntax/05.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToCodeBlocks }}

{{#markdown}}

Which is useful in reducing boilerplate when you need to evaluate code blocks with 2+ or more lines without the distracting boilerplate of wrapping
each expression within a `{{ ... }}` Template Expression.

### Languages

Refer to the languages page to learn about alternative languages you can use within Language Blocks and Expressions:

 - [#Script Code](/scode/) - use `code` language identifier
 - [#Script Lisp](/lisp/) - use `lisp` language identifier

### Language Blocks

`code` fragments are executed using `#Script` language blocks in the format:

    ```<lang>

    ```

Where `#Script` will parse the statement body with the language registered in its ScriptContext's `ScriptLanguages` collection that's pre-registered
with `ScriptCode.Language` which is used to process `code` block statements, e.g:

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/syntax/07.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToCodeBlocks }}

<p>
    Code Statement Blocks are evaluated within the same scope so any arguments that are assigned are also accessible within the containing page
    as seen above.
</p>
    
<h4 id="lisp-language">Evaluate Lisp</h4>

<p>
    You can use language blocks to embed and evaluate any of the languages registered in your <em>ScriptContext</em>, e,g. to evaluate
    <a href="/lisp">#Script Lisp</a> register it in your <em>ScriptContext</em> or <em>SharpPagesFeature</em>:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/lisp/01.md' |> githubMarkdown }}
    
<p>
    Where it will let you use Language Blocks to evaluate LISP code within <em>#Script</em>:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/syntax/08.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToLispBlocks }}

{{#markdown}}

Unlike `code` blocks, Lisp evaluates its code using its own Symbols table, it's able to reference arguments not in its Global symbols 
by resolving them from the containing scope, but in order for the outer `#Script` to access its local bindings they need
to be exported as seen above which registers the value of its `local-arg` value into the `result` argument. 
    
#### Language Block Modifiers

You can provide any additional modifiers to language blocks by specifying them after them after the `|` operator, languages
can use these modifiers to change how it evaluates the script. By default the only modifiers the built-in languages support are `|quiet`
and its shorter `|mute` and `|q` aliases which you can use to discard any output from being rendered within the page.
    
If you use Lisp's [setq special form](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_setq.htm) to assign a variable, 
that value is also returned which would be rendered in the page, you can ignore this output by using one of the above modifiers, e.g:
    
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/syntax/09.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToLispBlocks }}

{{#markdown}}
### Language Expressions
    
If you wanted to instead embed an expression in a different language instead of executing an entire statement block,
you can embed them within Language Expressions `{|<lang> ... |}`, e.g:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/syntax/10.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
You could also use them to evaluate `code` expressions, e.g. `{|code 1 + 2 |}`, but that's also how `#Script`
more concise Template Expressions are evaluated `{{ 1 + 2 }}`.   

### Multi-language support

Despite being implemented in different languages a `#Script` page containing multiple languages, e.g:

{{/markdown}}

{{ "linq-preview" |> partial({ rows:11, example: "linq01-langs", lang: 'template' }) }}

{{#markdown}}

Still only produces a **single page AST**, where when first loaded `#Script` parses the page contents as a contiguous
`ReadOnlyMemory<char>` where page slices of any [Language Blocks and Expressions](/docs/syntax#language-blocks-and-expressions) 
on the page are delegated to the `ScriptContext` registered `ScriptLanguages` for parsing which returns a fragment which is
added to the pages AST:

[![](/assets/img/multi-langs.svg)](/assets/img/multi-langs.svg)

When executing the page, each language is responsible for rendering its own fragments which all write directly to the pages `OutputStream`
to generate the pages output.

The multi-languages support in `#Script` is designed to be extensible where everything about the language is encapsulated within its
`ScriptLanguage` implementation so that if you omit its registration:

    var context = new ScriptContext {
    //    ScriptLanguages = { ScriptLisp.Language }
    }.Init();

Any language expressions and language blocks referencing it become inert and its source code emitted as plain-text.

### Language Comparisons

Whilst all languages have access to the same [Script Methods](/docs/methods) and [.NET Scripting interop](/docs/script-net), they all have 
unique characteristics that make them suitable for different use-cases. The default template syntax is ideal for generating text output where 
you need to embed logic when generating text output, [#Script Code](/scode/) is ideal when logic is more important then the text output like in 
[Sharp Scripts](/docs/sharp-scripts), whilst [#Script Lisp](/lisp/) is ideal for defining algorithms or for developers who prefer Lisp syntax 
or for devs who prefer development in a functional style.

A good comparison showing the differences, strengths and weaknesses of each language can be seen with the implementation of FizzBuzz in each language:

{{/markdown}}

{{#raw template}}
Template:
{{#each range(1,15) }}
{{#if it % 3 == 0 && it % 5 == 0}}
  FizzBuzz
{{else if it % 3 == 0}}
  Fizz
{{else if it % 5 == 0}}
  Buzz
{{else}}
  {{it}}
{{/if}}
{{/each}}

Code:
```code
#each range(1,15)
    #if it % 3 == 0 && it % 5 == 0
        "FizzBuzz"
    else if it % 3 == 0
        "Fizz"
    else if it % 5 == 0
        "Buzz"
    else
        it
    /if
/each
```

Lisp:
```lisp
(defn fizzbuzz [i]
    (cond ((and (zero? (mod i 3)) 
                (zero? (mod i 5))) "FizzBuzz")
          ((zero? (mod i 3))       "Fizz")
          ((zero? (mod i 5))       "Buzz")
          (t i)))

(dorun println (map fizzbuzz (range 1 16)))
```{{/raw}}

{{ 'live-template' |> partial({ rows:39, template }) }}

{{#markdown}}

#### Template

`#Script` is a **"template-first"** language where only expressions within `{{ ... }}` literals are evaluated, everything outside 
it is emitted verbatim, as consequence it's white-space sensitive where the indention of logic blocks affect its output as 
seen above where all lines are indented with the same 2 spaces as its free-text contents.

#### Code

By contrast [#Script Code](/scode/) is an inverted Templates where it's a **"code-first"** language where all statements are treated as code blocks
so statements don't require the `{{ ... }}` boilerplate and are not white-space sensitive. Like Templates each content block 
still generates output (unless its suppressed with the [quiet modifier](/docs/syntax#language-block-modifiers)) but needs to be a valid expression
like a string literal, argument or expression as seen in the **code** example above.

#### Lisp

[#Script Lisp](/lisp/) lets you use the venerable and highly dynamic and functional [Lisp language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29)
that's particularly strong at capturing algorithms and composing functions, although FizzBuzz isn't a particularly
good showcase of either of its dynamism of functional strengths, the last line shows a glimpse of its natural functional composition.

### Combine strengths of all Languages

As all languages compile down into the same AST block we can freely use all languages within the same Script block to take advantage
of the strengths of each, e.g. **Template** is great at generating text and **Lisp** excels at algorithms which make a great combination if you
ever need to combine the 2, so you could easily for example use the [defn Script Block](/docs/blocks#defn) to define a function
in Lisp, compiled to a .NET delegate so its invocable as a regular function inside a Template Block that generates markdown 
captured by the [capture Script Block](/docs/blocks#capture) and converted to HTML using the [markdown filter transformer](/docs/sharp-pages#markdown):
{{/markdown}}

{{#raw template}}
{{#defn fizzbuzz [i] }}
    (cond ((and (zero? (mod i 3)) 
                (zero? (mod i 5))) "FizzBuzz")
          ((zero? (mod i 3))       "Fizz")
          ((zero? (mod i 5))       "Buzz")
          (t i))
{{/defn}}

{{#capture md}}
