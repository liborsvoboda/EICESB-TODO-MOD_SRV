Unlike most languages, `#Script` has 2 outputs, the side-effect of the script itself and its textual output which makes it ideal for 
literate programming where executable snippets can be embedded inside an executable document. 

[code blocks](/docs/syntax#code-blocks) are a convenient markup for embedding executable scripts within a document without the distracting boilerplate 
of wrapping each statement in expression blocks. Together with `x watch`, `#Script` allows for an iterative, exploratory style of programming
in a live programming environment that benefits many domains whose instant progressive feedback unleashes an unprecedented amount of
productivity, one of those areas it benefits is shell scripting where the iterative feedback is invaluable in working towards a solution
for automating the desired task.

Some [protected script methods](/docs/protected-scripts) used to improve Usage in shell scripts, include:

 - `string proc(string exeFileName, {arguments:string, dir:string})`
    - Execute a local system process
        - **arguments**: command line args
        - **dir**: working directory
 - `sh(cmdArgs, {dir:string})`
    - Executes shell commands. Uses `cmd.exe /C {cmdArgs}` in Windows, otherwise `/bin/bash -c {cmdArgs}` on macOS/Linux
 - `string exePath(string exeName)` 
    - Returns the full path to an executable located in the users **$PATH**
 - `string osPaths(string path)` 
    - Rewrite paths to use `\` for Windows, otherwise uses `/`

From this list, you're likely to use `sh` the most to execute arbitrary commands with:

    cmd |> sh

> As with any `#Script` method, it can also be executed using the less natural forms of `cmd.sh()` or `sh(cmd)`

Which will emit the **StandardOutput** of the command if successful, otherwise it throws an Exception if anything was written to
the **StandardError**. Checkout the [Error Handling docs](https://sharpscript.net/docs/error-handling) for how to handle exceptions.

With the features in this release, `#Script` has now became our preferred way to create x-plat shell scripts which can be run
with the Windows [app](https://docs.servicestack.net/netcore-windows-desktop) or x-plat [x](https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool) dotnet tool which runs everywhere .NET Core does.

As such, all scripts in [ServiceStack/mix](https://github.com/ServiceStack/mix) provides a good collection of `.ss` scripts to check out
which are used to maintain the Gist content that powers the new `mix` feature.

#### Live Shell Scripting Preview  

To provide a glimpse of the productivity of this real-time exploratory programming-style, here's an example
of a task we needed to automate to import and rename **48px** SVG images from [Material Design Icons Project](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) folders into the form needed in the `mix` Gists:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/rename-icons.gif)](https://youtu.be/joXSHtfb_7g)

> YouTube: [youtu.be/joXSHtfb_7g](https://youtu.be/joXSHtfb_7g)

Here we can see how we're able to progressively arrive at our solution without leaving the source code, with the **watched** script 
automatically updated at each `Ctrl+S` save point where we're able to easily infer its behavior from its descriptive textual output.

#### Explore HTTP APIs in real-time

The real-time scriptability of `#Script` makes it ideal for a whole host of Exploratory programming tasks that would otherwise be painful
in the slow code/build/debug cycles of a compiled language like C#, like being able to cut, sort & slice HTTP APIs with ease:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/github-api.gif)](https://youtu.be/Yjx_9Tp91bQ)

> YouTube: [youtu.be/Yjx_9Tp91bQ](https://youtu.be/Yjx_9Tp91bQ)

#### Live Querying of Databases

It also serves a great tool for data exploration, akin to a programmable SQL Studio environment with instant feedback:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/query-northwind.gif)](https://youtu.be/HCjxVJ8RyPc)

> YouTube: [youtu.be/HCjxVJ8RyPc](https://youtu.be/HCjxVJ8RyPc)

That benefits from being able to maintain reusable queries in simple, executable text files that can be organized along with other 
shell scripts and treated like source code where it can be checked into a versionable repo, that anyone will be able to checkout and run 
from the command-line in Windows, macOS or Linux OS's.

> Refer to [Sharp App Docs](/docs/sharp-apps#multi-platform-configurations) for different `db.connection` examples of supported RDBMS's.

#### Utilize high-level ServiceStack Features

Here's another example showing the expressive power of `#Script` and its [comprehensive high-level library](https://sharpscript.net/docs/scripts-reference)
which is used to update all library dependencies of the [Vue and React "lite" Project Templates](/templates-lite):

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/12.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToCodeBlocks }}

{{#markdown}}

Running without any arguments:

    $ x run libraries.ss

will update both React and Vue dependencies:

    Writing to 26 files to react-lite-lib 'ad42adc11337c243ee203f9e9f84622c' ...
    Writing to 41 files to vue-lite-lib '717258cd4c26ba612e5eed0615d8d61c' ...

Alternatively it can be limited to updating a single Framework dependencies with:

    $ x run libraries.ss vue-lite-lib

The [web dotnet tool](https://docs.servicestack.net/web-new) also includes the capability of both **executing** `#Script` scripts as well
as **watching** scripts to enable a [live visual REPL](#live-script-with-web-watch) with instant real-time feedback that makes it perfect
for Exploratory tasks.

### Bundling and Minification

The Vue and React "lite" project templates take advantage of this in their 
[Pre-compiled minified production _bundle.ss script](https://docs.servicestack.net/templates-lite#pre-compiled-minified-production-bundles) 
which is run with `x run {script}`:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/10.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToCodeBlocks }}

{{#markdown}}
Which can be run with the `x` tool:

    $ dotnet tool install --global x 

    $ x run wwwroot/_bundle.ss

Which will create the production bundles, minify all already non-minified bundles and write them to disk with the paths written visible in the 
`#Script` *_bundle.ss* output:

#### Sharp Scripts run in context of Sharp Apps

Sharp Scripts are **run in the same context** and have access to the same functionality and features as a [Sharp App](/docs/sharp-apps) 
including extensibility va [custom plugins](/docs/sharp-apps#plugins). 
They can run **stand-alone** independent of an 
[app.settings](/docs/sharp-apps#ideal-for-web-designers-and-content-authors) config file, instead the app settings configuration
can be added in its page arguments to enable or configure any features.

Lets go through a couple of different possibilities we can do with scripts:

### AWS Dashboards

The [comprehensive built-in scripts](/docs/default-scripts) coupled with ServiceStack's agnostic 
providers like the [Virtual File System](/virtual-file-system) makes it easy to quickly query infrastructure resources
like all Tables and Row counts in managed AWS RDS Instances or Search for static Asset resources in S3 Buckets.
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/03.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToCodeBlocks }}

{{#markdown}}
You can use `$NAME` to move confidential information out of public scripts where it will be replaced with Environment 
Variables. Then run the script as normal and optionally provide a pattern for files you want to search for:

    $ x run script-aws.ss *.jpg

Where it displays a dashboard of activity from your AWS resources: containing all Tables with their Row Counts, 
adhoc queries like your last 5 Orders, The Root files and Folders available in your S3 Bucket and any matching resources 
from your specified search pattern:

    Querying AWS...

    | Tables                   ||
    |--------------------|------|
    | Order Detail       | 2155 |
    | Order              | 830  |
    | Customer           | 91   |
    | Product            | 77   |
    | Territory          | 53   |
    | Region             | 0    |
    | Shipper            | 0    |
    | Supplier           | 0    |
    | Category           | 0    |
    | Employee           | 0    |
    | Employee Territory | 0    |

    Last 5 Orders:

    | # | Id    | CustomerId | EmployeeId | Freight |
    |---|-------|------------|------------|---------|
    | 1 | 11077 | RATTC      | 1          | $8.53   |
    | 2 | 11076 | BONAP      | 4          | $38.28  |
    | 3 | 11075 | RICSU      | 8          | $6.19   |
    | 4 | 11074 | SIMOB      | 7          | $18.44  |
    | 5 | 11073 | PERIC      | 2          | $24.95  |

### Azure Dashboards

The nice thing about `#Script` late-binding and cloud agnostic providers is that with just different configuration we
can **use the exact same script** to query an Azure managed SQL Server Database and Azure Blob File Storage:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/04.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToCodeBlocks }}

{{#markdown}}
## Live #Script with 'web watch'

What's even nicer than the fast feedback of running adhoc scripts? Is the instant feedback you get from being able to **"watch"** the same script!

To watch a script just replace `run` with `watch`:

    $ x watch script-aws.ss *.jpg

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/sharpscript/watch-aws-azure.gif)](https://youtu.be/GQvxyPHQjhM)

> YouTube: [youtu.be/GQvxyPHQjhM](https://youtu.be/GQvxyPHQjhM)

The ability to run stand-alone adhoc scripts in an extensible dynamic scripting language feels like you're 
using a "developer enhanced" SQL Studio, where you can combine queries from multiple data sources, [manipulate them with LINQ](https://sharpscript.net/linq/restriction-operators) 
and quickly pipe results to dump utils to combine them in the same output for instant visualization.

`#Script` scripts can also be easily shared, maintained in gists and run on all different Win/OSX/Linux OS's that .NET Core runs on.

### Live Transformations

Another area where "watched" scripts can shine is as a "companion scratch pad" assistant during development that you can quickly switch to
and instantly test out live code fragments, calculations and transformations, e.g. This ends up being a great way to test out markdown syntax
and Nuglify's advanced compression using our new `minifyjs` and `minifycss` [Script Blocks](/docs/blocks):
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/05.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
Then run with:

    $ x watch livepad.ss

Which starts a live watched session that re-renders itself on save, initially with:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/06.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
### Live Session

### Adhoc reports

Scripts can use the built-in [Database Scripts](/docs/db-scripts) to be able to [run queries against any](/docs/sharp-apps#multi-platform-configurations) `sqlite`, `sqlserver`, `mysql` and `postgres` database and quickly view data snapshots using the built-in
[HTML Scripts](/docs/html-scripts#htmldump), e.g:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/01.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
#### Specifying Script Arguments

The above script generates a static HTML page can be invoked with **any number of named arguments** after the script name, in this case it
generates a report for Northwind Order **#10643**, saves it to `10643.html` and opens it in the OS's default browser:

    $ x run script.html -id 10643 > 10643.html && start 10643.html

Which looks like:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/sharpscript/10643.html.png)

### textDump

Generating static `.html` pages can quickly produce reports that looks good enough to share with others, 
but if you just want to see a snapshot info at a glance or be able to share in text-based mediums like email or chat
channels you can replace `htmlDump` with `textDump` where it will instead output GitHub flavored Markdown tables, e.g:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/02.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
As the output is human-readable we can view directly it without a browser:

    $ x run script.ss -id 10643 

Which will output:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/07.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}
And because they're GitHub Flavored Markdown Tables they can be embedded directly in Markdown docs (like this) where it's renders as:
{{/markdown}}

<div class='markdown-body'>
{{ 'gfm/sharp-scripts/08.md' |> githubMarkdown }}
</div>


{{ "doc-links" |> partial({ order }) }}
