## Ask a question

Remember:

* Please make your question as clear and specific as possible.
* Please check that the [documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/scaffolding) does not answer your question.
* Please search in both [open](https://github.com/dotnet/scaffolding/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/dotnet/Scaffolding/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to check that your question has not already been answered.

### Include your code

Usually the best way to ask a clear question and get a quick response is to show your code. Preferably, attach a small, runnable project or post a small, runnable code listing that reproduces what you are seeing.

Use triple-tick code fences for any posted code. For example:

```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

### Include stack traces

Include the full exception message and stack trace for any exception you encounter.

Use triple-tick fences for stack traces. For example:

```
Unhandled exception. System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
   at Bane.BigGuy() in C:\Batman\Foes\Bane.cs:line 420
   at Program.Main() in C:\Batman\Program.cs:line 69
```
