title: Protected Scripts
order: 13

<p>
    One of the goals of #Script is that its defaults should be safe enough to be able to execute arbitrary scripts by untrusted 3rd parties.
    Given this constraint, only default scripts are pre-registered which contain a comprehensive set of filters we deem safe for use by anyone.
    Other methods available in #Script which are useful to have in a server-generated website environment but we don't want 3rd Parties to 
    access are filters in 
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/Script/Methods/ProtectedScripts.cs">ProtectedScripts.cs</a>.    
</p>

<p>
    <em>ProtectedScripts</em> are not pre-registered when creating a new <em>ScriptContext</em> but they are pre-registered when 
    registering the <em>SharpPagesFeature</em> ServiceStack Plugin as that's designed to use #Script within a View Engine where access
    to its context is limited to the server's Web Application. 
</p>

<p>
    To access <em>ProtectedScripts</em> features within your own <em>ScriptContext</em> it can be
    <a href="/docs/methods#registering-methods">registered like any other filter</a>:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/protected-scripts/01.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4>includeFile</h4>
<div class="alias">fileContents</div>

<p>
    Use <em>includeFile</em> to embed content directly within pages:
</p>

{{ "live-pages" |> partial(
    {
        page: 'page', 
        files: 
        { 
            'page.html' : `I am a Page with a file
{{ 'my-file.txt' |> includeFile }}`,
            'my-file.txt' : `I am a text file`
        } 
    }) 
}}

<h5>Cascading resolution</h5>

<p>
    If an exact match isn't found it will look for the closest file with that name it can find, starting from the directory
    where the containing page that uses the filter is located and traversing up until it reaches the root folder.
</p>

<h4>includeFileWithCache</h4>
<div class="alias">fileContentsWithCache</div>

<p>
    If your <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system">VirtualFiles</a> is configured to use a combination
    of various sources that includes a remote file service like
    <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Aws#maintain-website-content-in-s3">S3VirtualFiles</a>, you'll
    likely want to cache the contents in memory to ensure fast subsequent access the next time the file is requested, 
    which you can cache without expiration using <em>includeFileWithCache</em> without arguments:
</p>

<pre class="cs">{{ pass: 'my-file.txt' |> includeFileWithCache }}<code></code></pre>

<p>
    In which case it will use the <b>1 minute</b> default overridable in <em>Args[DefaultFileCacheExpiry]</em>    
    or if you want the content to be refreshed after 1hr you can use:
</p>

<pre class="cs">{{ pass(`'my-file.txt' |> includeFileWithCache({ expiresInSecs: 3600 })`) }}<code></code></pre>

<h4>includeUrl</h4>
<div class="alias">urlContents</div>

<p>
    You can also embed the contents of remote URLs in your page using <em>includeUrl</em>:
</p>

{{ "live-pages" |> partial(
    {
        page: 'page', 
        files: 
        { 
            'page.html' : '{{ "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/sharpscript/master/src" |> to => src }}
{{ `${src}/wwwroot/examples/email-template.txt` |> includeUrl }}'
        } 
    }) 
}}

<p>
    <em>includeUrl</em> is actually a very flexible HTTP Client which can leverage the 
    <a href="/docs/default-scripts#url-handling">URL Handling</a> filters to easily construct urls and the additional
    filter arguments to customize the HTTP Request that's sent, here are some examples:
</p>

<p>
    Accept JSON responses:
</p>

{{#raw}}
<pre class="cs"><code>{{ url |> includeUrl({ accept: 'application/json' }) }}</code></pre>
<pre class="cs"><code>{{ url |> includeUrl({ dataType: 'json' }) }}</code></pre>

<p>
    Send data as <b>form-urlencoded</b> in a HTTP PUT Request with a <b>#Script</b> User-Agent:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ url |> includeUrl({ method:'PUT', data: { id: 1, name: 'foo' }, userAgent:"#Script" }) }}</code></pre>

<p>
    Send data as JSON in a HTTP POST request and Accept JSON response:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ url |> includeUrl({ method: 'POST', data: { id: 1, name: 'foo' }, 
                       accept: 'application/json', contentType: 'application/json' }) }}</code></pre>

<p>
    Shorter version of above request:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ url |> includeUrl({ method:'POST', data: { id: 1, name: 'foo' }, dataType: 'json' }) }}</code></pre>

<p>
    Send data as CSV in a HTTP POST Request and Accept a CSV response:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>includeUrl({ method:'POST', data: [{ id: 1, name: 'foo' }, { id: 2, name: 'bar' }], dataType:'csv' })</code></pre>


<h4 id="includeurlwithcache">includeUrlWithCache</h4>
<div class="alias">urlContentsWithCache</div>

<p>
    In the same way <em>includeFileWithCache</em> can cache file contents, <em>includeUrlWithCache</em> can cache URL content, 
    either without an expiration:
</p>


<pre class="cs">{{ url |> includeUrlWithCache }}<code></code></pre>

<p>
    In which case it will use the <b>1 minute</b> default overridable in <em>Args[DefaultUrlCacheExpiry]</em>    
    or if you want to ensure that no more than 1 url request is made per hour for this url you can specify a custom expiry with:
</p>

<pre class="cs">{{ url |> includeUrlWithCache({ expiresInSecs: 3600 }) }}<code></code></pre>
