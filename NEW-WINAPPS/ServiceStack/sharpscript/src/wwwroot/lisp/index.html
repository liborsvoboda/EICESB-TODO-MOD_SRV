`#Script` is designed as a small, expressive and wrist-friendly dynamic scripting language that for maximum familiarity
is modelled after the world's most popular and ubiquitous scripting Language, JavaScript. Its minimal syntax was inspired 
by other small but powerful languages which heavily utilizes functions instead of adopting a larger language grammar 
defining different bespoke syntax for language constructs.

Small Languages like Smalltalk, despite being one of the most influential languages in history, is famous for its minimal
[syntax that fits on a post card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#Syntax). A language with arguably better power 
to size ratio is [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) which the inventor of
Smalltalk, Alan Kay has credited it as being
the [greatest single programming language ever designed](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29)
after realizing: 

> “the half page of code on the bottom of page 13… was Lisp in itself. These were 
[“Maxwell’s Equations of Software!”](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/lisp-as-the-maxwells-equations-of-software/)

[Lisp's unprecedented elegance and simplicity](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/llog/jmc.pdf) spawned a [myriad of dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lisp-family_programming_languages),
some noteworthy implementations illustrating the beauty of its small size and expressive power is [lispy](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) by
by [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com) (Director of Google Research) that implements a Lisp interpreter in just **117 lines of Python 3 code** (inc. a REPL).

Another compact dialect is [Zick Standard Lisp](https://github.com/zick/ZickStandardLisp) which [@zick](https://github.com/zick) 
has implemented in **42 different languages** including a [recursive Lisp evaluator in Lisp](https://github.com/zick/ZickStandardLisp/blob/master/lisp.lsp)
implemented in only **66 lines of code**.

A more complete Lisp implementation in C# is the elegant [Nukata Lisp](https://github.com/nukata/lisp-in-cs) 
by [SUZUKI Hisao](https://github.com/nukata) which is a 
Common Lisp-like [Lisp-1](https://stackoverflow.com/q/4578574/85785) dialect with tail call optimization and partially hygienic macros, although
has some notable limitations including a [small standard library](https://github.com/nukata/lisp-in-cs/blob/d4258ec4b5681b0854a0d464b708df9ae26bbe3c/lisp.cs#L1216-L1391), 
only uses the `double` numeric type and doesn't contain .NET Scripting support.

### Script Lisp Overview

[ScriptLisp](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/Script/ScriptLanguage.Lisp.cs) is an
enhanced version of [Nukata Lisp](https://github.com/nukata/lisp-in-cs) with a number of new features
that reuses `#Script` existing scripting capabilities to provide seamless integration with both the rest of `#Script`
(see [Language Blocks an Expressions](/docs/syntax#language-blocks-and-expressions))
and .NET including [Scripting of .NET Types](/docs/script-net), support for all .NET numeric types and access to its comprehensive 
library of over **1000+** [Script Methods](/docs/methods) - optimally designed for accessing .NET functionality from a dynamic language.

To improve compatibility with existing Common Lisp source code it also implements most of the [Simplified Common Lisp Reference](http://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/)
as well as all missing functions required to implement C# LINQ 101 Examples in Lisp:

<div class="text-center my-3">
    <a href="/linq/restriction-operators?lang=lisp" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-lg">Lisp LINQ Examples</a>
</div>

To improve readability and familiarity it also adopts a number of **Clojure** syntax for defining a 
[data list and map](https://clojure.org/guides/learn/syntax#_literal_collections) literals, 
[anonymous functions](https://clojure.org/guides/learn/functions#_anonymous_function_syntax), 
syntax in [Java Interop](https://clojure.org/guides/learn/functions#_java_interop) for .NET Interop,
[keyword syntax for indexing collections](https://clojure.org/guides/learn/hashed_colls#_field_accessors) and accessing index accessors
and Clojure's popular shorter aliases for `fn`, `def`, `defn` - improving source-code compatibility with Clojure.

### Lisp REPL

In addition to being a 1st class language option in `#Script`, Lisp's dynamism and extensibility makes it particularly 
well suited for explanatory programming whose access via a REPL is now built into the latest 
[x](https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-tool) and [app](https://docs.servicestack.net/netcore-windows-desktop) dotnet tools 
which can be quickly installed in any Windows, macOS or Linux OS (with [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)) with: 

    $ dotnet tool install -g x

Or if you have a previous version installed, update to the latest version with:

    $ dotnet tool update -g x

Where you'll then be able to bring up an instant Lisp REPL with:  

    $ x lisp

The quick demo below shows the kind of exploratory programming available where you can query the `scriptMethods` available, 
query an objects `props`, query the Lisp interpreter's global `symbols` table containing all its global state including all 
defined lisp functions, macros and variables:

### Annotated REPL Walk through

Here's an annotated version of the demo below which explains what each of the different expressions is doing.

Just like [Sharp Scripts](/docs/sharp-scripts) and [Sharp Apps](/docs/sharp-apps) the Lisp REPL runs within the 
[#Script Pages](/docs/sharp-pages) ScriptContext [sandbox](/docs/sandbox) that when run from a Sharp App folder, 
starts a .NET Core App Server that simulates a fully configured .NET Core App. 
In this case it's running in the [redis Sharp App](https://github.com/sharp-apps/redis) directory where it was able to access its static web assets
as well as its redis-server connection configured in its [app.settings](https://github.com/sharp-apps/redis/blob/master/app.settings).

#### Enable features and access resources with app.settings

You can configure the Lisp REPL with any of the resources and features that [Sharp Apps](/docs/sharp-apps) and 
[Gist Desktop Apps](/docs/gist-desktop-apps) have access to, by creating a plain text `app.settings` file with all the 
features and resources you want the Lisp REPL to have access to, e.g. this [Pure Cloud App app.settings](/docs/sharp-apps#pure-cloud-apps)
allows the Lisp REPL to use [Database Scripts](/docs/db-scripts) against a AWS PostgreSQL RDS server and query remote 
[S3 Virtual Files](https://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system) using [Virtual File System APIs](/docs/protected-scripts#virtual-file-system-apis):

    # Note: values prefixed with '$' are resolved from Environment Variables
    name AWS S3 PostgreSQL Web App
    db postgres
    db.connection $AWS_RDS_POSTGRES
    files s3
    files.config {AccessKey:$AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY,SecretKey:$AWS_S3_SECRET_KEY,Region:us-east-1,Bucket:rockwind}

See the [plugins app.settings](/docs/sharp-apps#registering-servicestack-plugins) for examples of how to load and configure 
[ServiceStack Plugins](https://docs.servicestack.net/plugins).

### Lisp REPL TCP Server

In addition to launching a Lisp REPL from the Console above, you can also open a Lisp REPL into any ServiceStack App 
configured with the `LispReplTcpServer` ServiceStack plugin. This effectively opens a **"programmable gateway"** into any 
ServiceStack App where it's able to perform live queries, access IOC dependencies, invoke internal Server functions and query
the state of a running Server which like the [Debug Inspector](https://docs.servicestack.net/debugging#debug-inspector) 
can provide invaluable insight when diagnosing issues on a remote server.

To see it in action we'll enable it one of our production Apps [techstacks.io](https://techstacks.io) which as it's a 
Vuetify SPA App is only configured with an empty `SharpPagesFeature` as it doesn't use any server-side scripting features.

We'll enable it in `DebugMode` where we can enable by setting `DebugMode` in our App's `appsettings.Production.json` 
which will launch a TCP Socket Server which by default is configured to listen to the **loopback** IP on port `5005`.

{{ 'gfm/lisp/05.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}

> [ScriptNamespaces](/docs/script-net#type-resolution) behaves like C#'s `using Namespace;` statement letting you reference Types 
by `Name` instead of its fully-qualified Namespace.

Whilst you can now connect to it with basic `telnet`, it's a much nicer experience to use it with the [rlwrap](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rlwrap)
readline wrap utility which provides an enhanced experience with line editing, persistent history and completion.

    $ sudo apt-get install rlwrap

Then you can open a TCP Connection to connect to a new Lisp REPL with:

    $ rlwrap telnet localhost 5005

Where you now have full scriptability of the running server as allowed by [#Script Pages](/docs/sharp-pages) `SharpPagesFeature` which
allows [scripting of all .NET Types](/docs/script-net#allowscriptingofalltypes) by default. 

#### TechStacks TCP Lisp REPL Demo

In this demo we'll explore some of the possibilities of scripting the live [techstacks.io](https://techstacks.io) Server where we can 
`resolve` IOC dependencies to send out tweets using its registered `ITwitterUpdates` dependency, view the source and load a remote 
[parse-rss](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/3624b0373904cfb2fc7bb3c2cb9dc1a3) lisp function into the new Lisp interpreter attached to the TCP connection, 
use it to parse [Hacker News RSS Feed](https://news.ycombinator.com/rss) into a .NET Collection where it can be more easily queried using its built-in functions
which is used to construct an email body with **HN's current Top 5 links**. 

It then uses [DB Scripts](/docs/db-scripts) to explore its configured AWS RDS PostgreSQL RDBMS, listing its DB tables and viewing its 
column names and definitions before retrieving the Email addresses of all **Admin** users, sending them each an email with HN's Top 5 Links by 
publishing **5x** `SendEmail` Request DTOs using the [publishMessage](/docs/servicestack-scripts#publishmessage) ServiceStack Script to where 
they're processed in the background by its configured [MQ Server](https://docs.servicestack.net/messaging) that uses it to execute the 
`SendEmail` ServiceStack Service where it uses its configured AWS SES SMTP Server to finally send out the Emails:

### Password Protection 

Since TCP Server effectively opens your remote Server up to being scripted you'll want to ensure the TCP Server is only accessible
within a trusted network, effectively treating it the same as [Redis Security Model](https://redis.io/topics/security).

A secure approach would be to leave the default of only binding to `IPAddress.Loopback` so only trusted users with SSH access will 
be able to access it, which they'll still be able to access remotely via `Local PC > ssh > telnet 127.0.0.1 5005`.

Just like [Redis AUTH](https://redis.io/commands/auth) you can also add password protection for an additional layer of Security:

### Run and watch Lisp Scripts

The same [Sharp Scripts](/docs/sharp-scripts) functionality for `#Script` is also available to Lisp scripts where you can use the `x` and `app`
dotnet tools to **run** and **watch** stand-alone Lisp scripts with the `.l` file extension, e.g: 

    $ x run lisp.l
    $ x watch lisp.l

To clarify the behavioural differences between the Lisp REPL's above which uses the **same Lisp interpreter** to maintain state changes across each command, 
the `watch` Script is run with a **new Lisp Interpreter** which starts with a **fresh** copy of the Global symbols table so any state changes after each 
`Ctrl+S` save point is discarded.

### Watch `lisp` scripts

This quick demo illustrates the same functionality in [Sharp Scripts](/docs/sharp-scripts) is also available in `lisp` scripts 
where it provides instant feedback whilst you develop in real-time:

#### Page Arguments

You can also use the same syntax for declaring any `app.settings` page arguments used in `#Script` and `code` Scripts:

    <!--
     db sqlite
     db.connection northwind.sqlite
    -->

But for compatibility with any Lisp syntax highlighters and code editors they can also be prefixed with a `;` line comment as seen above.

## Executing Lisp in .NET

Lisp like all `#Script` languages are executed within a `ScriptContext` that defines all functionality available to them, i.e:

### Evaluating Lisp Script Results

If you instead wanted to access return values instead of its rendered output, use the `EvaluateLisp()` APIs:

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/lisp/08.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}

## .NET Interop

The syntax for .NET Interop is inspired directly from Clojure's syntax used for [Java Interop](https://clojure.org/reference/java_interop).
See [Scripting .NET Type Resolution](/docs/script-net#type-resolution) for how to configure Types and imported Namespaces you want your 
Lisp scripts to have access to.

### Member Access

The `'.'` prefix if for accessing an instance members which can be used for retrieving a properties public properties, fields and
invoking instance methods, e.g:

- **(.Property instance)**
- **(.Field    instance)**
- **(.Method   instance ...args)**

### Indexer Access

Use `':'` prefix for accessing a Types indexer or for indexing collections, e.g:

- **(:key indexer)**
- **(:"string key" dictionary)**
- **(:n list)**
- **(:n array)**
- **(:n enumerable)**
- **(:n indexer)**

It can also be used to access an instance public Properties and Fields:

- **(:Property instance)**
- **(:Field    instance)**

However for readability we recommend using `'.'` prefix above to convey instance member access.

### Constructor Access

Use `'.'` **suffix** for creating instances of Types:

- **(Type. ...args)**
- **(Namespace.Type. ...args)**

You can also create instances using the [new script method](/docs/script-net#creating-instances), which as it accepts a 
`string` Type Name can be used to create generic classes with multiple generic args, e.g:

- **(new "Type" ...args)**
- **(new "Type&lt;T1,T2,T3&gt;" ...args)**

### Static Member Access

Use the `'/'` separator to access a Type's static members or to invoke its static methods, e.g:

- **(StaticType/Property)**
- **(StaticType/Field)**
- **(StaticType/Const)**
- **(StaticType/Method ...args)**

Use `'.'` dot notation for specifying the fully-qualified Type name or to reference its Inner classes, e.g:

- **(Namespace.StaticType/Member)**
- **(Namespace.StaticType.InnerType/Member)**

### Script Methods

Use `'/'` prefix to reference any Script Method registered in your `ScriptContext`:

- **(/scriptMethod ...args)**

Script Methods without arguments can be referenced as an [argument binding](/docs/default-scripts#as-bindings) 
that when referenced as an argument (i.e. without brackets) are implicitly evaluated, in-effect making them a calculated property:

- **/methodAsBinding**

While a `'/'` prefix indicates a reference to a [script method](/docs/methods), for readability it can be excluded as when 
there's no existing symbol defined in the Lisp interpreter's symbol table it will fallback to referencing a script method:

- **(scriptMethod ...args)**
- **methodAsBinding**

This does mean that when there exists a `symbol` of the same name defined you will need to use the `'/'` prefix to reference a script method.

### Generic Types

All references above support referencing generic types and methods with a single generic Type argument, e.g:

- **(StaticType/Method&lt;T&gt;)**
- **(GenericStaticType&lt;T&gt;/Member)**
- **(GenericStaticType&lt;T&gt;/Method&lt;T&gt;)**
- **(GenericType&lt;T&gt;.)**

As `','` is one of Lisp's few syntax tokens ([unquoting](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/02_df.htm)) it prevents them
from being able to use them to specify multiple generic arguments.

Instead you'll need to use the [Constructor function](/docs/script-net#creating-instances) for referencing constructors with multiple generic
arguments where you'll also need to specify the types of the exact constructor you want to call, e.g:

- **(/C "Tuple&lt;String,int&gt;(String,int)")**

The difference between the `/C` script method constructor function and Lisp's `C` function is that the script method only returns a reference
to the constructor which you'll need to invoke with arguments to create an instance:

- **((/C "Tuple&lt;String,int&gt;(String,int)") "A" 1)**

Whilst Lisp's `C` function will auto-invoke the constructor function with the supplied arguments in a single expression:

- **(C "Tuple&lt;String,int&gt;(String,int)" "A" 1)**

Likewise when needing to invoke generic methods with multiple generic args you'll need to use [Function](/docs/script-net#function):

- **((/F "Tuple.Create&lt;String,int&gt;(String,int)") "A" 1)**

Or Script Lisp's `F` function for invoking a function reference in a single expression:

- **(F "Tuple.Create&lt;String,int&gt;(String,int)" "A" 1)**

For more examples and information see [Scripting .NET Types](/docs/script-net).

### Property Setters

You can populate multiple properties on an instance using the [set script method](/docs/script-net#user-content-set), e.g:

- **(set instance { :Prop arg ... })**

Alternatively properties can be set individually with:

- **(.Prop instance arg)**

### Lisp Lists vs .NET Collections

A potential source of friction when interoperating with .NET is that Lisp Lists are [Cons Cells](https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/lisp/cons/)
so that a code or data list in Lisp, i.e:

    '(1 2 3)
    [1 2 3]
    
Is implemented as a Linked List of Cons cells:

    (1 . (2 . (3 . null)))

Which is what Lisp's core functions expect to operate on, namely:

    car cdr caar cadr cdar cddr caaar caadr cadar caddr cdaar cdadr cddar cdddr append mapcar consp cons?
    listp list? memq member assq assoc nreverse last nconc dolist dotimes mapcan mapc nthcdr nbutlast 

These core Lisp functions can't be used against .NET collections directly, instead you can use 
`(to-cons collection)` to convert a .NET `IEnumerable` collection into a cons list, e.g:

    (cdr (to-cons netEnumerable))

Should you need to do the inverse you can use `(to-list cons-list)` to convert a cons list to a .NET List, e.g:

    (to-list (range 10))

We've made Script Lisp's cons `Cell` an `IEnumerable` so that **all other built-in Lisp functions** can operate on both 
cons cells and .NET Collections where instead of iterating a list with `(do-list)` you can use `(do-seq)` to iterate
both .NET Collections and cons cells, e.g:

    (do-seq (x collection) (println x) )

### Importing Global Scripts

Importing scripts in Lisp is essentially a 2-stage process of parsing Lisp source code into an [SExpression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression), 
(basically Lisp's AST of tokenized elements captured in a [2-field Cons Cell](https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/lisp/cons/)) then evaluating it in a 
Lisp interpreter where any defined symbols are captured in its Symbols table.

Lisp Script captures its "standard library" in a Global Interpreter which serves as the starting template for all other Lisp Interpreters 
which starts with a copy of the Global symbols table which you can further populate with your own common functions using `Lisp.Import()`, e.g:

{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/lisp/10.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

{{#markdown}}

### Loading Scripts

Loading scripts within a Lisp script works similarly except they're only loaded into that Lisp interpreters symbol table, a new one
of which is created in each new `PageResult`.

Scripts loaded locally are loaded from the `ScriptContext` configured [Virtual Files Provider](https://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system) 
which for [#Script Pages](/docs/sharp-pages) `SharpPagesFeature` is configured to use the App's cascading virtual file sources. 

A new `ScriptContext` starts with an empty [MemoryVirtualFiles](https://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system#virtual-file-systems-available)
which you can write files to with:

### #Script Pages Integration

Whilst Lisp is a small, powerfully expressive functional dynamic language it's not great for use as a templating language. 
Whilst there have been [several attempts to create a HTML DSL in Lisp](https://www.cliki.net/HTML%20generator), nothing is better
than having **no syntax** which is the default **Template mode** for `#Script` where it will emit everything that's not in a 
Template or Language Expression as verbatim text.

A nice USP of Script Lisp is that you're never forced into going "full Lisp", you can utilize `#Script` template expressions and
[Script Blocks](/docs/blocks) handlebars syntax that provides the ideal DSL for usage in a Template Language for generating HTML
and utilize your preferred `Lisp` or [Code](/scode/) Script Languages for any computational logic you want included in your page
using [Language Blocks and Expressions](/docs/syntax#language-blocks-and-expressions).

#### Implementation

Despite being implemented in different languages a `#Script` page containing multiple languages, e.g:

{{/markdown}}

{{ "linq-preview" |> partial({ rows:11, example: "linq01-langs", lang: 'template' }) }}

{{#markdown}}

Still only produces a **single page AST**, where when first loaded `#Script` parses the page contents as a contiguous
`ReadOnlyMemory<char>` where page slices of any [Language Blocks and Expressions](/docs/syntax#language-blocks-and-expressions) 
on the page are delegated to the `ScriptContext` registered `ScriptLanguages` for parsing which returns a fragment which is
added to the pages AST:

[![](/assets/img/multi-langs.svg)](/assets/img/multi-langs.svg)

When executing the page, each language is responsible for rendering its own fragments which all write directly to the pages `OutputStream`
to generate the pages output.

The multi-languages support in `#Script` is designed to be extensible where everything about the language is encapsulated within its
`ScriptLanguage` implementation so that if you omit its registration:

    var context = new ScriptContext {
    //    ScriptLanguages = { ScriptLisp.Language }
    }.Init();

Any language expressions and language blocks referencing it become inert and its source code emitted as plain-text.

### Lisp Argument Scopes

One differentiator between Lisp and [Code](/scode/) languages is that `code` utilizes the containing page current scope
for all its argument references where as Lisp stores all its definitions within the Lisp interpreter symbol table
attached to the `PageResult`, so whilst Lisp scripts can access arguments within the pages scope, in order for the 
outer page to access any Lisp symbols they need to be exported, e.g:

{{/markdown}}

{{ "live-template" |> partial({ output:'no-scroll', rows:9, template: "```code|q
pageResultArg = 2
var scopeArg = 3
```
...lisp
(export retVal (+ pageResultArg scopeArg) 
        newVal 2)
...
Result: {{ retVal + newVal }}".replace('...','```') }) }}

{{#markdown}}

### Exporting Lisp Functions

Lisp functions can also be exported for usage in the rest of the page by calling `(to-delegate lispFn)` to convert it 
into a .NET Delegate, e.g:

{{/markdown}}

{{ "live-template" |> partial({ output:'no-scroll', rows:7, template: "
{{ var scopeArg = 1 }}
...lisp
(def localArg 2)
(def lispAdd  #(+ %1 %2 localArg))
(export lispAdd (to-delegate lispAdd))
...
Result: {{ lispAdd(scopeArg, 3) }} or {{ scopeArg.lispAdd(3) }}".replace('...','```') }) }}

{{#markdown}}

Although an easier way to define functions in Lisp is to use the [defn Script Block](/docs/blocks#defn) which wraps
this in a convenient syntax:

{{/markdown}}

{{ "live-template" |> partial({ output:'no-scroll', rows:12, template: "{{#defn calc [a, b] }}
    (def c (* a b))
    (+ a b c)
{{/defn}}

{{#defn fib [n] }}
    (if (<= n 1)
        n
        (+ (fib (- n 1))
           (fib (- n 2)) ))
{{/defn}}
calc: {{ calc(1,2) }}, fib: {{ 10.fib() }} ".replace('...','```') }) }}

{{#markdown}}

### Controlling Lisp output

One of Lisp's famous traits is **everything is an expression** which is typically desired within a language, but may not 
be what you want when generating output. E.g traditionally Lisp uses [setq](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_setq.htm)
to set a variable which also returns its value that `#Script` will emit as it automatically emits all statement return values. 

You could use `def` which is an alias for `setq` which returns `null`, other options include wrapping all statements within an empty `let`
expression where only the last expression is returned, or you could use a [Language Block Modifier](/docs/syntax#language-block-modifiers)
to ignore the entire `lisp` block output and only export the result you want to be able to control precisely where to emit it:

{{/markdown}}

{{ "live-template" |> partial({ output:'no-scroll', rows:18, template: `
<b>default:</b>
...lisp
(setq result (+ 1 1))
(str "1 + 1 = " result)
...
<b>let:</b>
...lisp
(let ()
    (setq result (+ 1 1))
    (str "1 + 1 = " result))
...
<br><b>quiet block:</b>
...lisp|q
(setq result (+ 1 1))
(export ret (str "1 + 1 = " result))
...
{{ ret }}
`.replace('...','```') }) }}

{{#markdown}}

> can use either 'q', 'quiet' or 'mute' block modifier to ignore output

Another way to generate output from Lisp is to use its built-in print functions below:

 - **(print ...args)** - write all arguments to the `OutputStream`
 - **(println ...args)** - write all arguments to the `OutputStream` followed by a **new line**
 - **(printlns ...args)** - write all arguments to the `OutputStream` with a `' '` **space delimiter** followed by a **new line**
 - **(pr ...args)** - same as `print` but **HTML encode** all arguments
 - **(prn ...args)** - same as `println` but **HTML encode** all arguments
 
### dorun

[dorun](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/dorun) can be used for executing a "statement block" (sequence of expressions) 
with side-effects that you want to discard the return type (akin to `void` return type):

    (dorun println (map fizzbuzz (range 1 100)))

Or you can use `do` to return the last expression in the statement block:

    (do (+ 1 1) (+ 2 2))       ; 4
    (do (+ 1 1) (+ 2 2) nil))  ; null
    (do ())                    ; null

## Learn #Script Lisp

A great resource for learning Script Lisp is seeing it in action by seeing how to implement **C#'s 101 LINQ Examples in Lisp**:

### Explore APIs in real-time

We can also take advantage of Lisp's dynamism and interactivity to explore APIs in real-time, a great way to do this is via
a [watched Lisp script](#run-and-watch-lisp-scripts) on the side where it provides instant feedback after each `Ctrl+S` save point
or a active [Lisp REPL](#lisp-repl).

- **symbols** - List all symbols in Lisp interpreter - most symbols are named after [standard Lisp](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/X_AllSym.htm)
or [clojure functions](https://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet)
- **(symbol-type symbol)** - Display the Symbol's Value Type
- **scriptMethods** - List all available Script Method Names registered in `ScriptContext`
- **scriptMethodTypes** - List all available Script Method Type information
- **(joinln collection)** - Display the string output of each item in the collection on a separate line 
- **(globln pattern collection)** - Only display lines matching the glob pattern
- **(typeName instance)** - View the instance Type Name
- **(props instance)** - Display the Property names of an Instance public properties
- **(fields instance)** - Display the Field names of an Instance public fields
- **(methods instance)** - Display the Method names of an Instance public methods
- **(propTypes instance)** - Get the PropertyInfo[] of an Instance public properties
- **(fieldTypes instance)** - Get the FieldInfo[] of an Instance public fields
- **(methodTypes instance)** - Get the Script Method Infos of an Instance public methods
- **(staticProps instance)** - Display the Property names of an Instance public static properties
- **(staticFields instance)** - Display the Field names of an Instance public static fields
- **(staticMethods instance)** - Display the Method names of an Instance public static methods
- **(staticPropTypes instance)** - Get the PropertyInfo[] of an Instance public static properties
- **(staticFieldTypes instance)** - Get the FieldInfo[] of an Instance public static fields
- **(staticMethodTypes instance)** - Get the Script Method Infos of an Instance public static methods

You can view the [Scripts API Reference](/docs/scripts-reference) and [Scripts Documentation](/docs/default-scripts)
on this website to interactively explore the available APIs, we'll work on providing further interactive documentation
for the built-in Lisp functions, in the mean-time the best resource are 
[their implementation](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/32185f14aaf93d768dda5673381aa0d2fdbe34b4/src/ServiceStack.Common/Script/ScriptLanguage.Lisp.cs#L3106-L3508).

For reference, here's are a quick list of all built-in Lisp symbols:

Common Lisp by convention uses a `*p` suffix for **predicate** functions but we prefer Clojure's (and Ruby's)
more readable `*?` suffix convention, for source-code compatibility we include both for 
[core Lisp predicts](http://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/index.html) and just `*?` for others.
