As an example, C#'s 101 LINQ examples [most complicated LINQ expression](https://sharpscript.net/linq/grouping-operators#linq43-groupby---nested) 
can now be rewritten from its original source:

```hbs
{{ customers 
   |> map => { 
        CompanyName: it.CompanyName, 
        YearGroups: map (
            groupBy(it.Orders, it => it.OrderDate.Year),
            yg => { 
                Year: yg.Key,
                MonthGroups: map (
                    groupBy(yg, o => o.OrderDate.Month),
                    mg => { Month: mg.Key, Orders: mg }
                ) 
            }
        ) 
     }
     |> htmlDump }}
```

to use extension methods which greatly improves its readability as its execution flow is now able to read from left-to-right:

```hbs
{{ customers |> map => { 
    CompanyName: it.CompanyName, 
    YearGroups: it.Orders.groupBy(it => it.OrderDate.Year).map(yg =>
        { 
            Year: yg.Key,
            MonthGroups: yg.groupBy(o => o.OrderDate.Month).map(mg => 
                { Month: mg.Key, Orders: mg }
            ) 
        }
      ) 
   }
   |> htmlDump }}
```
