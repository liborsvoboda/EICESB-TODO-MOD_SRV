<p>
    You can apply a chain of multiple Stream transformations to transform output using Transformers which are just functions that
    accept an Input Stream and return a modified Output Stream. The MarkdownPageFormat's <em>TransformToHtml</em> shows an example
    of a Transformer which converts Markdown Input and returns a Stream of HTML output:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/01.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="output-transformers">Output Transformers</h4>

<p>
    You can transform the entire output of a Script with Output Transformers which you would do if both your <b>_layout</b>
    and <b>page</b> both contain markdown, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/02.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h5>PageResult with Output Transformer</h5>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/03.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<p>
    After the Script is evaluated it's entire output gets passed into the chain of OutputTransformers defined, which in this case will
    send a MemoryStream of the generated Markdown Output into the <em>MarkdownPageFormat.TransformToHtml</em> transformer which returns
    a Stream of converted HTML which is what's written to the OutputStream.
</p>

<h4 id="page-transformers">Page Transformers</h4>

<p>
    You can also apply Transformations to only the Page's output using Page Transformers which you would do if only the <b>page</b> was in 
    Markdown and the <b>_layout</b> was already in HTML, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/04.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h5>PageResult with Page Transformer</h5>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/05.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="filter-transformers">Filter Transformers</h4>

<p>
    Filter Transformers are used to apply Stream Transformations to <a href="/docs/methods#block-methods">Block Methods</a> which you 
    could use if you only wanted to convert an embedded Markdown file inside a Page to HTML. You can register Filter Transformers 
    in either the ScriptContext's or PageResult's <em>FilterTransformers</em> Dictionary by assigning it the name you want it available in
    your Scripts under, e.g:
</p>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/06.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h5>PageResult with Filter Transformer</h5>

{{ 'gfm/transformers/07.md' |> githubMarkdown }}

<h4 id="htmlencode">htmlencode</h4>

<p>
    The <em>htmlencode</em> Filter Transformer is pre-registered in ScriptContext which lets you encode Block Method outputs
    which is useful when you want to HTML Encode a text file before embedding it in the page, e.g:
</p>

<pre class="cs"><code>{{ pass: "page.txt" |> includeFile |> htmlencode }}</code></pre>

<h4 id="preprocessors">Preprocessor Code Transformations</h4>

{{#markdown}}
Preprocessors allows you to perform source-code transformations before `#Script` evaluates it which is useful when you want to 
convert any placeholder markers into HTML or `#Script` code at runtime, e.g. this feature could be used to replace translated text with the
language that the App's configured with to use on Startup. 

With this feature we can also change how [#Script's Language Block Feature](/docs/syntax#language-blocks-and-expressions) is implemented where
we could instead use a [simple TransformCodeBlocks PreProcessor](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Common/Script/ScriptPreprocessors.cs) 
to process any `code` bocks by registering in the `Preprocessors` list:

    var context = new ScriptContext {
        Preprocessors = { ScriptPreprocessors.TransformCodeBlocks }
    }.Init();

There by overriding the existing implementation with the code transformation below:

#### Code Transformation

This preprocessor performs a basic transformation that assumes every statement is an expression and wraps them in an `{{...}}` 
expression block, the exception are expressions which are already within an expression block which are ignored and you still
need to use to wrap multi-line expressions in `code` blocks.

The other transformation `code` blocks perform is collapsing new lines and trimming each line, this is so scripts which are primarily 
structured and indented for readability aren't reflected in its text output. 

We can see an example of how `code` blocks work from the example below:
{{/markdown}}

{{ 'gfm/syntax/06.md' | githubMarkdown | convertScriptToCodeBlocks }}
