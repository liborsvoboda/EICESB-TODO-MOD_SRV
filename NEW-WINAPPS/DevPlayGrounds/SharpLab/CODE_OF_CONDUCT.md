## Code of Conduct

SharpLab and related open-source projects follow [Contributor Covenant 2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).

The following SharpLab-specific notes apply

* Enforcement contact: sharplab.conduct@gmail.com

* SharpLab currently has a single maintainer. I do believe that enforcement is essential for a working Code of Conduct, so I will apply my best effort to get it done. However life and work priorities and emergencies can prevent me from reacting to reports promptly and efficiently.
